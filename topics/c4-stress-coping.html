                            Mastery of these terms prevents the "vague phrasing" that frequently leads to mark loss. For
                            example,
                            using "stress" as a synonym for "somatic anxiety" ignores the specific physiological
                            activation
                            requirements of the 2026 syllabus. Precise terminology is the primary tool for earning marks

                            2's "Explain" and "Analyse" questions.

                            Examiners penalize students who treat "Arousal" and "Anxiety" as synonyms. Arousal is a
                            neutral
                            state of
                            activation; anxiety is a negative emotional interpretation of that activation.

                            the "controllability" of the stressor.</p>

                            Using
                            an emotion-focused strategy (like relaxation) for a controllable issue (like incorrect
                            equipment) is
                            inefficient and may lead to performance decline.
