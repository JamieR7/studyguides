        <h2>Quick reference: key terms</h2>

        <p>
            In the IB Sports, Exercise and Health Science (SEHS) examination, the "Sports Psychology and Motor Learning" theme demands high linguistic precision. Section C.4 specifically explores the boundary between physiological activation and psychological interpretation. For Paper 2 responses, distinguishing between the mechanisms of activation and the strategies for management is essential; vague terminology often differentiates a Grade 4 response from a Grade 7.

            <h4>Outline (C.4.1)</h4>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Outline the Inverted U Theory.</p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> It suggests that performance increases with arousal up to an optimal midpoint, after which further increases lead to a steady, gradual decline in performance. <strong>[2 marks]</strong></p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Explain (C.4.1)</h4>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Explain the mechanism of Catastrophe Theory.</p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> When cognitive anxiety is low, performance follows the Inverted U. However, if cognitive anxiety (worry) is high, increases in somatic arousal cause a sudden "catastrophe"—a vertical drop in performance rather than a gradual decline—because the athlete's cognitive threshold is breached. <strong>[3 marks]</strong></p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Analyse (C.4.1)</h4>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Analyse the relationship between multidimensional anxiety and performance.</p>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> This requires breaking down anxiety into cognitive (mental) and somatic (physical) elements. Performance is not just a result of physical activation; it is the interaction between the two. High cognitive anxiety shifts the arousal-performance relationship from a predictable curve to a high-risk "catastrophe" model, meaning mental state dictates the physical outcome. <strong>[4 marks]</strong></p>

            <p><strong>A:</strong> <strong>Strengths:</strong> (1) It is empirically identified as the most effective strategy for athletes; (2) it is versatile, functioning as both problem-focused (technical advice) and emotion-focused (empathy). <strong>Limitations:</strong> (1) It carries a risk of "co-rumination," where excessive focus on the problem with peers increases anxiety; (2) it creates a dependency on external figures, potentially reducing an athlete's perceived self-control. <strong>[4 marks]</strong></p>

        <h2>Content summary</h2>

        <p>
            Performance outcomes are dictated by the holistic system involving physical activation (arousal) and the cognitive management of the resulting stress (coping).

        <h3>4.1 Arousal and Anxiety (C.4.1)</h3>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Theoretical Evolution</h4>
            <p>
                Drive Theory (linear) is largely dismissed for failing to account for "choking." The Inverted U Theory introduced the midpoint, but the Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning (IZOF) is more precise, acknowledging that optimal arousal is a personal range, not a universal point.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Catastrophe Theory Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>High cognitive anxiety (worry) is established as the primary condition.</li>
                <li>Somatic arousal (physical activation) increases toward the optimal point.</li>
                <li>A "threshold" is reached where the combination of worry and physical intensity becomes unmanageable.</li>
                <li>Performance "crashes" suddenly, requiring the athlete to drastically lower arousal to recover.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Application:</strong> A sprinter may feel "pumped" (high somatic) but if they begin to worry about a false start (high cognitive), their motor patterns may tighten, leading to a mechanical failure in the blocks (catastrophe).
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>TIP:</strong> Measuring arousal via objective data (Heart Rate/Blood Pressure/Galvanic Skin Response) is more reliable than subjective self-reports, which are prone to social desirability bias.
        </div>

        <h3>4.2 Coping (C.4.2)</h3>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Stressors</h4>
            <p>Categorized as <strong>Controllable</strong> (e.g., equipment prep) or <strong>Uncontrollable</strong> (e.g., weather). Strategy selection must match the stressor type for effectiveness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Strategy Effectiveness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem-focused:</strong> Best for controllable factors (e.g., seeking info, effort expenditure).</li>
                <li><strong>Emotion-focused:</strong> Best for uncontrollable factors (e.g., relaxation, thought control).</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Talk:</strong> Moving from unintentional (reactive) to intentional (proactive). Mechanisms include using acronyms of helpful phrases or single words to trigger complex movements (e.g., "Snap" for a swim start).</li>
                <li><strong>Seeking Support:</strong> The most effective strategy. Can be problem-focused (coach feedback) or emotion-focused (talking to a psychologist).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> Avoidance-focused coping (distancing/procrastinating) is maladaptive. While short-term distraction can lower immediate anxiety, it prevents the athlete from achieving long-term performance goals.

            <div class="error-explanation">
                Labeling "taking a deep breath" as avoidance. It is actually emotion-focused coping. Avoidance requires distancing from the task.

            <div class="error-explanation">
                Forgetting that a catastrophe only happens when cognitive anxiety is high. If cognitive anxiety is low, the curve follows the Inverted U.

            <div class="error-explanation">
                Calling distraction "maladaptive" in all cases. It is a useful short-term emotion-focused tool, even if it doesn't reach long-term goals.

                High arousal can also manifest as positive "excitement" (desire/elation) if cognitive anxiety is low.

        <div class="linking-card">
            <div class="linking-question">
                Link to A.1.1 (Nervous System): How does the autonomic nervous system drive the stress response?
            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                <strong>Point:</strong> High arousal activates the Sympathetic Nervous System, triggering the "fight or flight" response (increased HR/BP). Relaxation strategies aim to activate the Parasympathetic Nervous System to return to homeostasis.
            </div>
        </div>

            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                <strong>Point:</strong> Individuals high in Neuroticism perceive situations as more distressing and struggle with cognitive anxiety. Conversely, those high in Conscientiousness exhibit more goal-directed behavior and are more likely to employ effective problem-focused coping (Source C.1.1).

        <h2>Self-test checklist</h2>

        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Can I explain why performance "crashes" in Catastrophe Theory only when cognitive anxiety is high?</li>
            <li>Can I distinguish between problem-focused (technical) and emotion-focused (relaxation) coping?</li>
            <li>Do I know the difference between objective (HR/GSR) and subjective (Self-report) arousal measures?</li>
            <li>Can I evaluate "Seeking Support" using 2 distinct strengths and 2 distinct limitations?</li>
            <li>Can I calculate percentage change and standard deviation for arousal data?</li>
            <li>Can I define IZOF and explain why it makes the Inverted U Theory more precise?</li>
            <li>Do I understand that conscientious personality traits facilitate goal-directed coping strategies?</li>
