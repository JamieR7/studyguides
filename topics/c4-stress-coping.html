            <h1>Topic C.4: Stress and Coping</h1>
            <p style="font-size:1.15rem; color:#666; margin-bottom:2rem;">In the field of Sports Psychology, the
                precision of your language is the definitive barrier between a superficial response and an expert-level
                analysis. IB examiners strictly evaluate the application of terminology to distinguish between
                physiological activation (arousal) and the subsequent emotional interpretation of that state (anxiety).
                Mastering these terms ensures that your responses in Paper 2 are theoretically grounded, preventing the
                vague phrasing that characterizes low-scoring candidates.</p>

                <strong>So What? Layer:</strong><br>
                Mastery of these terms prevents the "vague phrasing" that frequently leads to mark loss. For example,
                using "stress" as a synonym for "somatic anxiety" ignores the specific physiological activation
                requirements of the 2026 syllabus. Precise terminology is the primary tool for earning marks in Paper
                2's "Explain" and "Analyse" questions.

                    In a championship tennis match, a player with high worry (cognitive) may experience a "catastrophe"
                    after a double fault increases their heart rate (somatic) beyond their limit, leading to a complete

                    <strong>TIP:</strong><br>
                    Examiners penalize students who treat "Arousal" and "Anxiety" as synonyms. Arousal is a neutral
                    state of
                    activation; anxiety is a negative emotional interpretation of that activation.

                <h3>C.4.2 Coping <span class="page-ref">p. 49</span></h3>
                <p>Coping strategies are the tools used to maintain homeostasis. Their effectiveness is strictly
                    dictated by
                    the "controllability" of the stressor.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Problem-focused, Emotion-focused, and Avoidance-focused coping;
                    Self-talk;
                    Relaxation; Social support.</p>

                <p><strong>Maladaptive Strategies:</strong> These hinder goal attainment and include venting (unpleasant
                    emotional outbursts), self-blame, and mental/physical disengagement (withdrawal).</p>

                <div class="subsection-header">How Self-Talk Functions</div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recall:</strong> Accessing positive past experiences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Acronyms:</strong> Using "cue words" (e.g., "SMOOTH") to trigger focus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Instruction:</strong> Describing a movement in one word (e.g., "SNAP") to simplify
                            complex tasks.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="real-world-example">
                    <strong>Sporting Application:</strong><br>
                    A swimmer uses problem-focused coping by adjusting their goggles (controllable stressor) or
                    emotion-focused coping (self-talk) to manage the fear of a stronger opponent (uncontrollable
                    stressor).

                <div class="note-box">
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong><br>
                    Seeking support is the most effective coping strategy for athletes. It can be problem-focused
                    (seeking
                    technical advice) or emotion-focused (seeking comfort).
                </div>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>So What? Layer:</strong><br>
                    The 2026 syllabus emphasizes that problem-focused coping is superior for controllable stressors.
                    Using
                    an emotion-focused strategy (like relaxation) for a controllable issue (like incorrect equipment) is
                    inefficient and may lead to performance decline.

                                    Arousal and somatic anxiety are physical manifestations of the Autonomic Nervous
                                    System. When a
                                    stressor is detected by chemoreceptors (sensing changes in blood acidity/CO2), the
                                    medulla oblongata
                                    sends nervous signals via the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate and
                                    ventilation.
                                    This physiological "cascade" is what we measure as somatic anxiety in C.4.1.

                                    High stress is a major internal risk factor for injury. Psychological strain leads
                                    to attentional
                                    narrowing (C.2.2), causing an athlete to miss external cues (like an opponent's
                                    position).
                                    Simultaneously, stress increases muscle tension (B.1.3), which reduces joint
                                    flexibility and
                                    increases the risk of acute trauma (B.3.1.2).

                        failure
                        to manage psychological stressors (C.4) inevitably manifests as physiological decline (A.1) or
