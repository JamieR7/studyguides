                                        <strong>Model Answer:</strong> The psychological refractory period occurs when
                                        two stimuli
                                        are presented in close succession. It refers to the delay in responding to the
                                        second
                                        stimulus because the first stimulus is still being processed by the brain's
                                        single-channel
                                        information processing system. Welford (1968) demonstrated that if a second
                                        stimulus is
                                        presented before the response to the first is completed, the reaction time to
                                        the second
                                        stimulus is significantly longer. A common sporting example is a soccer player
                                        faking a shot
                                        (stimulus 1) before making the actual move (stimulus 2), causing the defender to
                                        react
                                        slowly to the real movement. <span class="page-ref">p.455-456</span>

                                        <strong>Question:</strong> Explain why an external focus of attention generally
                                        leads to
                                        better performance than an internal focus.<br><br>
                                        <strong>Model Answer:</strong> An external focus of attention, which directs
                                        attention to
                                        the intended movement effect (e.g., the ball hitting the target), is generally
                                        more
                                        effective because it promotes a more automatic and efficient mode of motor
                                        control. Studies
                                        show that an external focus speeds up the learning process and improves
                                        accuracy,
                                        consistency, and efficiency. This is because focusing externally allows the
                                        motor system to
                                        self-organize without conscious interference. In contrast, an internal focus on
                                        body
                                        movements (e.g., the position of one's arm) can disrupt this automaticity,
                                        leading to less
                                        efficient movement and slower performance. <span class="page-ref">p.486</span>

                                        <strong>Model Answer:</strong> Welford's model breaks down information
                                        processing into a
                                        sequence of stages. It begins with Input from the environment, which is received
                                        by the
                                        senses in the Sensation stage. This sensory information is then interpreted in
                                        the
                                        Perception stage, where it is compared to past experiences stored in long-term
                                        memory. The
                                        next stage is Decision, where the performer selects an appropriate response. The
                                        motor
                                        programme for this response is organized in the Efferent organization stage.
                                        Finally, the
                                        selected action is carried out as Output. The success of this output provides
                                        Feedback,
                                        which informs future actions and completes the processing loop. Although
                                        presented linearly,
                                        these processes can occur simultaneously. <span class="page-ref">p.451</span>

                                        approach may be necessary initially to ensure safety and build foundational

                            skills. It
                            explores the critical distinction between innate ability and learned skill, the difference
                            between a
                            temporary performance and permanent learning, and the models that describe how our brains
                            process
                            information to produce movement. Understanding these processes is strategically vital for
                            coaches and
                            athletes, as it provides the theoretical framework for designing effective practice,
                            providing feedback,
                            and navigating the journey from novice to expert.</p>

                            <li><strong>Skill vs. Ability:</strong> A skill is learned, whereas an ability is an innate
                                trait we are
                                born with. Abilities are the perceptual and motor attributes that give us the capacity
                                to perform
                                skills. <span class="page-ref">p.447</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Learning vs. Performance:</strong> Performance is a temporary display of a skill
                                that can
                                fluctuate, whereas learning is a relatively permanent change in the ability to perform
                                that skill,
                                resulting from practice or experience. <span class="page-ref">p.448</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Transfer of Learning:</strong> This refers to how previous experience with one
                                skill affects
                                the learning or performance of another. This transfer can be positive (helping),
                                negative
                                (hindering), or zero (no effect). <span class="page-ref">p.449</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Information Processing:</strong> This is a framework for understanding how
                                humans take in
                                information from the environment, process it, and use it to produce a motor response.

                                is inconsistent, with many mistakes. The performer requires significant attention and
                                may use
                                verbalization to aid memory (e.g., "pull, brake, switch, slide").</li>

                            The psychological refractory period (PRP) is demonstrated effectively in sports involving
                            deception. For
                            example, in basketball, a player might fake a shot (the first stimulus, S1). The defender
                            begins to
                            react to this fake. The offensive player then immediately performs the actual movement, such
                            as a drive
                            to the basket (the second stimulus, S2). Because the defender is still processing and
                            responding to S1,
                            their response to S2 is significantly delayed, giving the offensive player an advantage.
                            Similar feints
                            are seen in soccer and boxing. <span class="page-ref">p.456</span>

                        <h3>C.2.2 Attentional control</h3>
                        <p>This sub-topic delves into the cognitive mechanisms that govern focus and concentration,
                            which are
                            hallmarks of elite performance. It examines how athletes direct their mental effort, filter
                            out
                            distractions, and manage the relationship between their physiological arousal and their
                            ability to
                            process information. For coaches and athletes, mastering attentional control is a key
                            strategic goal, as
                            the ability to focus on the right cues at the right time is often what separates success
                            from failure in
                            high-pressure sporting environments.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Attentional Focus Dimensions:</strong> Attention can be viewed along two
                                dimensions: width
                                (broad or narrow) and direction (internal or external). This creates four types of
                                focus: broad
                                external, broad internal, narrow external, and narrow internal. <span
                                    class="page-ref">p.482</span>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Distractors:</strong> Athletes can lose concentration due to internal
                                distractors (e.g.,
                                thoughts, worries, fatigue) and external distractors (e.g., crowd noise, opponent
                                actions, weather).
                                <span class="page-ref">p.479</span>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Arousal:</strong> This is the level of physical and psychological activation,
                                ranging from
                                low (relaxed) to high (intense). High arousal is linked to increased heart rate, rapid
                                breathing,
                                and feelings of excitement or anxiety. <span class="page-ref">p.484</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Attentional Narrowing:</strong> A tendency for individuals to focus their
                                attention on a
                                limited set of cues when in a state of high arousal. <span class="page-ref">p.484</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="subsection-header">Mechanism of Attentional Narrowing</div>

                        <p>Increased arousal triggers a predictable effect on attention:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>As an athlete's arousal level increases, their attentional field begins to narrow.</li>
                            <li>This can be beneficial, as it helps the athlete filter out irrelevant distractions and
                                focus on the
                                most important cues (e.g., a basketball player focusing only on the rim and ball during
                                a free
                                throw).</li>
                            <li>However, if arousal becomes too high, the attentional field can become excessively
                                narrow.</li>
                            <li>This negative effect causes the athlete to miss important peripheral cues (e.g., an open
                                teammate),
                                leading to a reduction in overall performance. <span class="page-ref">p.484</span></li>

                            An elite golfer teeing off in front of a crowd provides an excellent example of managing

                            focus.<br><br>
                            <strong>Controlled Distraction:</strong> The golfer first acknowledges potential

                            distractors like wind, hazards (water, bunkers), and the shape of the fairway. They direct
                            their
                            attention to these factors to make an informed plan.<br><br>
                            <strong>Pre-Shot Routine:</strong> The golfer then narrows their focus using a well-learned
                            routine.
                            This may involve visualizing the ball's trajectory, using a trigger word like "target," and
                            focusing
                            exclusively on the execution of the swing. This routine helps to block out negative thoughts
                            and
                            external distractions, ensuring attention remains on the task-relevant information required

                                    The results support the theory that an external focus of attention enhances motor
                                    performance.
                                    The distal focus (an external focus further from the body) produced the fastest
                                    times. This is
                                    because an external focus promotes a more automatic, efficient mode of motor
                                    control, allowing
                                    the athlete's body to self-organize without conscious interference. The control and

                                    focus conditions were less effective, likely because they either allowed for or
                                    encouraged a
                                    more internal focus, which can disrupt the natural fluency of the movement.

                                    The statement is largely inaccurate. While learning curves plot performance, they
                                    are only an
                                    indirect indicator of learning. Limitations: A single performance is a temporary
                                    occurrence and
                                    can be affected by factors like fatigue or motivation, which are not reflective of

                                    learning. Furthermore, performance plateaus do not necessarily mean learning has
                                    stopped; the
                                    athlete could be consolidating skills. Strengths: Despite these limitations,
                                    tracking
                                    performance consistently over time is the primary way we can infer that learning—a

                                    throw down into smaller, sequential parts. For example, they might start with drills
                                    focusing
                                    only on the "correct" stance and foot position, followed by drills on hand position
                                    on the ball,
                                    then the arm extension, and finally the wrist flick. The approach would be
                                    coach-led, with the
                                    coach providing prescriptive feedback on the "right" technique. Practice would
                                    involve static,
                                    blocked repetition, such as shooting 20 times from the exact same spot with no
                                    defenders, before
                                    moving on to the next drill. The goal is to build the technique piece by piece
                                    through
                                    mechanical repetition. <strong>[4]</strong><br><br>

                                    mechanics of the shot. They would be highly reliant on the coach's instructions and
                                    demonstrations. Their movements would be uncoordinated, inconsistent, and they would
                                    make many
                                    errors (e.g., shooting with two hands, incorrect footwork). They would need to
                                    concentrate fully
                                    on each component of the skill. As they practice, they would transition to the
                                    associative
                                    phase. Here, they begin to link the different parts of the free throw into a
                                    smoother motion.
                                    Their performance would become more consistent, and they would be able to recognize
                                    and start
                                    correcting their own errors. Practice is key in this phase to refine the movement
                                    pattern and
                                    make it more fluid and accurate. <strong>[4]</strong>

                                    To manage concentration, the tennis player could implement several strategies based
                                    on
                                    attentional control principles. Firstly, the player needs to manage their arousal.
                                    High anxiety
                                    on crucial points can lead to excessive arousal, causing negative attentional
                                    narrowing where
                                    they miss important cues. They could use arousal regulation techniques, such as
                                    controlled
                                    breathing, to lower their physiological arousal to an optimal level. Secondly, they
                                    can develop
                                    a strong pre-shot routine. A consistent routine between points can help them switch
                                    their
                                    attention from distractions (like crowd noise) to task-relevant information. This
                                    routine could
                                    involve visualizing a successful serve, bouncing the ball a set number of times, and
                                    using a
                                    trigger word (e.g., "target") to narrow their focus onto an external cue, like the
                                    spot they
                                    want to hit in the service box. Thirdly, they should practice controlled
                                    distraction. This
                                    involves actively directing their attention to task-relevant cues to block out the
                                    irrelevant
                                    noise. For example, they can deliberately focus on the spin of the ball or the
                                    position of their
                                    opponent. This is a form of selective attention that can be trained. By using these
                                    strategies,
                                    the player can better control their attentional focus, maintain concentration under
                                    pressure,
                                    and reduce the likelihood of making errors due to external distractors.
