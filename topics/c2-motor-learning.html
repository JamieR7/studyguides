        <h2>Quick reference: key terms</h2>

        <p>
            In the International Baccalaureate (IB) Sports, Exercise and Health Science (SEHS) examination, "precision of communication" is a vital marking criterion. Mastery of terminology is a strategic necessity, as it allows a candidate to distinguish between transient behavioral changes and stable neurological adaptations. Responses that fail to use these terms with surgical accuracy often fail to access the top markbands, regardless of the student's conceptual understanding.

        <p>
            Topic C.2 Motor Learning represents a substantial portion of the SEHS assessment, appearing across the entire examination suite. Candidates must be prepared to pivot from the rapid, objective recall required in Paper 1 to the high-level synthesis and evidence-based evaluation demanded in Paper 2.

        <span class="section-badge">📖 Section 4</span>
        <h2>Content summary: C.2.1 Motor Learning & C.2.2 Attentional Control</h2>

        <h3>C.2.1 Motor Learning Processes</h3>

        <p>
            Motor learning examines how athletes acquire and refine movement patterns. Strategically, coaches must distinguish between temporary performance fluctuations and the permanent skill acquisition that defines learning.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>The Learning/Performance Distinction</h4>
            <p>
                Performance is a temporary occurrence, fluctuating over time due to factors like fatigue or luck (p.448). Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from practice or experience.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Welford's Information Processing Model (p.451)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Input/Sensation:</strong> Exteroceptors (vision/audition) or interoceptors (vestibular/joint receptors) relay info.</li>
                <li><strong>Perception:</strong> The brain interprets and makes sense of the sensory information.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> The brain compares the current information held in STM with past experiences in LTM (a continuous loop) to choose a response.</li>
                <li><strong>Efferent Organization:</strong> The CNS prepares the specific motor commands.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> The actual execution of the movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Results (intrinsic/extrinsic) are used to adjust future attempts.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Pedagogical Approaches</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Pedagogy:</strong> Teacher-centered; uses repetitive, "reductionist" drills to facilitate basic technique acquisition (p.449).</li>
                <li><strong>Non-linear Pedagogy:</strong> Learner-centered; uses "Self-Organization" where athletes adapt movements based on task and environmental constraints (p.460).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Motor Programmes</h4>
            <p>
                Open-loop control is used for very fast movements (60–70 ms) that cannot be altered mid-action. Closed-loop control uses the "perceptual trace" (memory of the movement feel) to allow for adjustments during the action (p.459).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>HICK'S LAW:</strong> Reaction time increases as the number of stimulus-response choices increases. This is a linear relationship when reaction time is plotted against the log of stimulus-response couplings (p.455).
        </div>

        <h3>C.2.2 Attentional Control</h3>

        <p>
            Proficiency requires an athlete to focus on task-relevant cues while filtering out irrelevant "noise," which can be external (crowd) or internal (anxiety).
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Dimensions of Attention</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Deliberate mental effort on the task.</li>
                <li><strong>Selective Attention:</strong> Filtering irrelevant distractions to focus on specific cues (p.476).</li>
                <li><strong>Divided Attention:</strong> Coordinating multiple actions simultaneously (e.g., dribbling while scanning for teammates).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Attentional Focus (p.482)</h4>
            <p>
                Focus is categorized by Width (Broad/Narrow) and Direction (Internal/External). High-level performance is often associated with a Broad-External focus for assessment and a Narrow-External focus for execution.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Arousal & Narrowing</h4>
            <p>
                High arousal causes "Attentional Narrowing," reducing the amount of available information for the decision-making process (p.485).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            <strong>MEMORY LIMITS:</strong> Short-term memory has a capacity of 7±2 "bits" of information. While capacity is fixed, "chunking" (grouping items) allows each bit to contain more information (p.453).
        </div>

        <p>
            Internal processes eventually manifest as observable athletic skill on the field.

                    A coach may use Linear Pedagogy initially to build confidence through structured, "reductionist" drills, which allow the novice to master basic technique in a stable environment (p.469). However, they should transition to Non-linear Pedagogy to encourage "self-organization." This allows the learner to find individualized movement solutions based on task constraints (e.g., varying hoop height). This "exploratory learning" increases skill adaptability and ensures the player can perform in the "dynamic" environment of a real game, avoiding the limitations of isolated rote repetition.

                    Schmidt proposed two schemas: the recall schema, used to select and initiate the serve based on past experience, and the recognition schema, which allows the player to "feel" the movement via the perceptual trace and make adjustments (p.459). The player uses the recognition schema to evaluate the outcome and update the motor programme for future serves.

        <div class="working-steps">
            <h4>Worked Example (Sprinter)</h4>
            <p>A sprinter has a reaction time (gun to blocks) of 0.15s and a movement time (blocks to 10m) of 1.85s.</p>
            <p><strong>Total Response Time = 0.15s + 1.85s = 2.00s.</strong></p>

                SD is used to assess consistency. A large SD in a basketball player's shooting indicates high performance variability, whereas a low SD suggests a stable, "learned" skill (p.468).

                Link C.2 to B.1 (Biomechanics): How do "Degrees of Freedom" interact with self-organization in non-linear pedagogy?
            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                <strong>Point:</strong> During early learning, athletes often "freeze" degrees of freedom (limiting joint movement) to simplify the task. As they self-organize through non-linear practice, they "release" these degrees of freedom, coordinating them into efficient levers to achieve mechanical advantage (p.469).
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                <strong>Point:</strong> Mental toughness involves managing stress and arousal levels. An athlete with high mental toughness can prevent the excessive narrowing of their attentional field under pressure, maintaining a complete "picture" of relevant environmental cues (p.485).

            <li>Can I differentiate between a positively accelerated and a negatively accelerated learning curve?</li>
            <li>Can I explain the role of the "perceptual trace" in closed-loop control?</li>
            <li>Can I calculate response time using provided data points and the correct units (s/ms)?</li>
            <li>Can I describe the "bottleneck" effect in the Psychological Refractory Period?</li>

        <p style="margin-top:2rem;">
            Self-testing is the most effective form of "rehearsal" for moving information from short-term into long-term memory. Structured revision ensures your performance on exam day reflects true learning.
