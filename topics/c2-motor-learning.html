                    <strong>Q:</strong> Outline key features of a non-linear pedagogical approach.<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Non-linear pedagogy is developed based on ecological dynamics. It involves exploratory learning and encourages individualized movement solutions. In this learner-centred approach, teachers modify individual, task and environmental constraints to support exploration.

                    <strong>Q:</strong> Explain the psychological refractory period (PRP) concept.<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> PRP occurs because humans have single-channel information processing—we can only process one piece at a time. When a second stimulus (S2) is presented shortly after a first (S1), S2 processing cannot occur until S1 processing is complete. This creates a delay, and response time to S2 is slower than normal. This slowed response period to the second stimulus is the psychological refractory period.

                    <strong>Q:</strong> Analyse different constraint types in dynamical systems theory.<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Movement patterns are shaped by three constraint types. Individual constraints are personal characteristics (height, weight, motivations, fitness level). Task constraints relate to activity goals (game rules, implement size, performance instructions). Environmental constraints are external factors (weather, playing surface, slope). The interaction between these three types determines available movement solutions.

                    <strong>Q:</strong> Evaluate linear and non-linear pedagogical approaches.<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> <strong>Linear strengths:</strong> Structured, sequential nature provides clear pathway for complete novices by breaking complex skills into basic parts. <strong>Linear limitations:</strong> Decontextualized, drill-based practice often fails to transfer effectively into dynamic real performance. Non-linear pedagogy addresses this weakness by using representative, game-like scenarios where athletes learn to adapt. <strong>Non-linear strengths:</strong> Learner-centred focus promotes problem-solving and motivation by encouraging exploration of own movement solutions. <strong>Non-linear limitations:</strong> Requires highly skilled coach to effectively manipulate constraints; exploratory nature could overwhelm novices lacking foundational understanding.

            Topic C.2 investigates how humans acquire, refine and perform skills, providing frameworks for optimizing training and performance under pressure.
        </p>

        <h3>C.2.1 Motor learning processes</h3>

        <p>
            Understanding the underlying processes of skill acquisition is crucial for coaches, teachers and athletes aiming to optimize training effectiveness.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Learning vs Performance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Relatively permanent change in performance brought about by experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Temporary occurrence, fluctuating over time—what we observe and measure.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Performance is observable action at single point in time, influenced by temporary factors. Learning is inferred internal change resulting in consistently improved performance potential.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Golfer putting practice:</strong> Early learner attempts are scattered and inconsistent. After significant practice, putts become clustered around the hole, demonstrating relatively permanent capability change. Individual attempts are performances; sustained improvement over time is evidence of learning.
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            Performance is what we observe and measure; learning is the underlying change we infer from sustained performance improvements.
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Transfer of learning</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive transfer:</strong> Practice of one task facilitates learning/performance of another.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative transfer:</strong> Practice of one task inhibits learning/performance of another.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero transfer:</strong> No effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Transfer refers to how previous experiences influence new skill learning, occurring between different skills, from practice to performance, or between limbs (bilateral transfer).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Information processing (Welford's model)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Input/Sensation:</strong> Performer receives environmental information through senses (sight of ball, opponent sound).</li>
                <li><strong>Perception:</strong> Brain interprets sensory information, comparing it to long-term memory (LTM) past experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Performer decides what action to take based on situation perception, involving short-term memory (STM).</li>
                <li><strong>Efferent organization:</strong> Brain sends motor commands to relevant muscles to carry out selected response.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Performer executes movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Information about movement outcome is received, used to adjust future actions.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            While models like Welford's present stages linearly, many processes are carried out simultaneously in reality, not in simple sequential chain.
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Psychological Refractory Period (PRP)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> According to Broadbent's filter model, we have limited information processing capacity. Selective attention acts as filter, allowing only important stimuli to pass into limited-capacity system. PRP occurs because of single-channel processing—response to second stimulus is delayed until first has been dealt with.</li>
                <li><strong>Hick's Law:</strong> As number of stimulus-response choices increases, reaction time increases linearly.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Rugby dummy pass:</strong> Initial ball movement is first stimulus (S1); defender begins responding. Actual pass in different direction is second stimulus (S2). Defender's reaction to S2 is delayed because still processing S1, illustrating psychological refractory period.
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Fitts & Posner phases of learning</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cognitive phase:</strong> Initial stage where learner tries to make sense of skill. Performance is inconsistent with many crude errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Associative phase:</strong> Practice stage where learner refines skill. Movements become more consistent and coordinated.</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous phase:</strong> Final stage where skill is performed automatically with little conscious thought. Performer can focus on strategy and tactics.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Motor control models</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open-loop control:</strong> Mode for fast movements (under 60-70 ms) executed as pre-programmed sequence without feedback. Like firing a cannon—once initiated, runs to completion without alteration. Example: boxing jab too fast for feedback to modify mid-action.</li>
                <li><strong>Closed-loop control:</strong> Mode for slower movements relying on feedback to make real-time adjustments. Like steering a car—driver constantly uses visual feedback to compare current position to intended path and make corrections.</li>
                <li><strong>Schema Theory (Schmidt):</strong> Proposes we develop generalized motor programmes. Includes recall schema (for initiating action) and recognition schema (for evaluating movement feel). Explains how we adapt generalized motor programme (throwing) to novel situations (different objects to different targets).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Pedagogical approaches</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear pedagogy:</strong> Traditional, teacher-centred approach characterized by reductionist perspective—skills broken into basic parts and learned in structured, sequential progression (cognitive → associative → autonomous stages). Focuses on repetitive drills to perfect specific technique with prescriptive feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-linear pedagogy:</strong> Learner-centred approach based on ecological dynamics, involving exploratory learning and encouraging individualized solutions by manipulating constraints (individual, task, environment). Creates representative learning environments (e.g., small-sided games) where learner is encouraged to self-organize and discover effective movement patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Dynamical Systems Theory (DST)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core concept:</strong> Views motor learning as process where movement patterns "self-organize" based on multiple component interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Factors shaping movement—individual (height, motivation), task (rules, equipment), environmental (weather, surface).</li>
                <li><strong>Perception-action coupling:</strong> Direct link between what an individual perceives and the action they subsequently take.</li>
                <li><strong>Affordances:</strong> Opportunities for action that an environment provides to an individual.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Moves away from brain-as-computer metaphor. Proposes coordinated movement emerges from dynamic learner–environment interaction. Individual, task and environment constrain available movement solutions; performer perceives affordances to achieve their goal.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>C.2.2 Attentional control</h3>

        <p>
            Managing attention effectively in competitive environments is essential for executing skills under pressure and avoiding performance breakdown.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Dimensions of attention</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Ability to invest mental effort in what is most important in any given situation; central point of attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Selective attention:</strong> Athlete's ability to "zoom in" on task-relevant information while ignoring potential distractions.</li>
                <li><strong>Divided attention:</strong> Ability to perform or coordinate two or more actions simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Large body of evidence shows external focus results in more effective performance and faster learning.

                    The psychological refractory period (PRP) is the delay in a person's response to a second stimulus (S2) when presented very soon after a first stimulus (S1). <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    This occurs because humans have a single channel for information processing, meaning S2 processing cannot begin until S1 processing is complete. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    For example, in rugby, an attacker might perform a dummy pass (S1), causing a defender to commit to tackling in that direction. The attacker then actually passes or runs in a different direction (S2). <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    The defender's reaction to the actual movement (S2) will be significantly delayed because they're still completing their response to the initial dummy (S1), illustrating the PRP and often creating a defensive gap. <strong>[1 mark]</strong>

                    <strong>Linear approach:</strong> A linear approach is teacher-centred and reductionist. The coach would break the basketball shot down into its component parts. <strong>[1 mark]</strong> They might have the child practice just the "correct" stance and ball release without a hoop (static blocked practice). <strong>[1 mark]</strong> The coach would provide explicit instructions and prescriptive feedback, focusing on achieving an idealized "perfect" technique through repetition. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>

The coach would design a game-like situation, perhaps a 1-on-1 game to a small target, to provide performance context. <strong>[1 mark]</strong> Instead of prescribing a single technique, the coach would manipulate constraints to guide the learner's discovery. For example, they might use a smaller, lighter ball (task constraint) or lower the hoop (environmental constraint) to encourage the child to explore and find a shooting solution that works for their individual constraints (e.g., their height and strength). <strong>[1 mark]</strong> The focus is on the outcome (scoring) and allowing the technique to emerge, rather than on perfecting the form in isolation. <strong>[1 mark]</strong>

                    "As an archer, managing your arousal—your level of mental and physical activation—is key to performance. When you get nervous in competitions, your arousal level increases significantly. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    This has a direct effect on your attention. As arousal goes up, your attentional field tends to narrow. <strong>[1 mark]</strong> A little bit of this is good; it can help you filter out distractions like the crowd or your opponent. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    However, if your arousal gets too high, this narrowing becomes excessive, leading to 'tunnel vision'. Your muscles might also become too tense. <strong>[1 mark]</strong> This can be disastrous in archery, as you might focus too much on a single negative thought, like 'don't miss', or become overly rigid, preventing the fluid motion needed for an accurate shot. You might also miss important environmental cues, like a sudden change in the wind. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Strategy 1—Pre-shot routine:</strong> To manage this, we can implement a consistent pre-shot routine. <strong>[1 mark]</strong> A well-learned routine of specific thoughts and actions before each shot makes your behaviour automatic and prevents you from over-thinking or focusing on negative thoughts. This promotes an optimal attentional focus on the relevant cues of the task. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Strategy 2—Trigger words:</strong> Second, we can use trigger words. This involves using a simple, single-word self-talk cue, such as 'smooth' or 'focus', right before you release. This word acts as an anchor to direct your attention to a key aspect of the skill, helping you to stay focused outwards on your actions and the target, rather than inwards on your doubts or nerves." <strong>[1 mark]</strong>

            <div class="error-title">Treating all transfer of learning as positive</div>
            <div class="error-explanation">
                Students sometimes forget that prior experience can hinder new skill learning (negative transfer). For example, badminton wrist action might negatively transfer to tennis, where a firmer wrist is required.

            <div class="error-title">Overlooking feedback in closed-loop control</div>
            <div class="error-explanation">
                The defining feature of closed-loop control is its reliance on feedback. The movement is constantly adjusted by comparing current state feedback (memory trace) to desired state (perceptual trace). Open-loop control operates without feedback.

        <div class="linking-card">
            <div class="linking-question">
                How can attentional control principles (C.2.2) help prevent negative effects of attentional narrowing linked to mental toughness (C.1.2)?
            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                Mental toughness involves managing stress and maintaining focus under pressure. Strategies from C.2.2, such as pre-performance routines and trigger words, are practical tools athletes can use to regulate arousal, prevent excessive attentional narrowing and maintain optimal focus, thereby demonstrating mental toughness.

        <div class="linking-card">
            <div class="linking-question">
                How can video technology (B.2.3) be used to provide feedback and monitor progress through learning phases (C.2.1)?
            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                In cognitive phase, video can show learner the discrepancy between their movement and a model. In associative phase, it can be used for detailed frame-by-frame analysis to refine technique. For autonomous phase athletes, post-performance video review can help identify subtle tactical errors without disrupting automatic skill execution.

        <div class="linking-card">
            <div class="linking-question">
                How can constraints in dynamical systems theory (C.2.1) relate to injury risk (B.3)?
            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                Individual constraints (e.g., fatigue, previous injury, biomechanical limitations) interact with task constraints (e.g., training load, technique demands) and environmental constraints (e.g., surface quality) to influence movement patterns. Poor constraint interaction can lead to maladaptive movement patterns increasing injury risk. Understanding this helps coaches manipulate constraints to promote safer, more effective movement solutions that reduce injury likelihood.
