They actively seek challenging situations, particularly 50-50 success probability, to prove ability. They display high effort, continue trying in difficult situations, and focus on pride from success rather than shame from failure.

                    <strong>A:</strong> High ego orientation with low task orientation focuses motivation on demonstrating superior ability and winning rather than self-improvement, lacking focus on self-referenced goals. If perceived ability is low, anxiety, stress or challenge avoidance occurs to protect ego. This outperforming-others focus decreases activity enjoyment and satisfaction, potentially leading to dropout.

Effectively explains individual behaviour differences by considering goal orientation–perceived ability interaction. <strong>Limitations:</strong> Criticized for potential cultural bias (Western, male-biased development). Reductionist—considers only two main goals; individuals may hold multiple simultaneous goals influenced by wider factors.

        <h2>Content summary</h2>

        <p>
            Topic C.3 examines foundational motivation theories, self-determination and motivational climate creation to enhance athletic performance and sustained participation.
        </p>

        <h3>C.3.1 Achievement motivation</h3>

        <p>
            Foundational theories explore the interplay between personality and situational factors, providing frameworks for analysing motivation in sporting contexts.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Key concepts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motivation definition:</strong> The direction and intensity of individual's effort.</li>
                <li><strong>Intrinsic vs extrinsic:</strong> Internal factors (fun, enjoyment) vs external factors (rewards, praise).</li>
                <li><strong>Need Achievement Theory (McClelland and Atkinson):</strong> Motivation as balance between motive to achieve success (Ms) and motive to avoid failure (Maf).</li>
                <li><strong>Goal Orientation Theory:</strong> Individuals motivated by achieving goals—task-oriented (self-improvement focused) or ego-oriented (outperforming others focused).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Need Achievement Theory mechanism</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Personality factors:</strong> Individual possesses innate motive to achieve success and motive to avoid failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Situational factors:</strong> They assess probability of success and incentive value in given situation.</li>
                <li><strong>Resultant tendency:</strong> They decide to approach success or avoid failure. High achievers (Ms > Maf) approach challenges, especially 50% success probability. Low achievers (Maf > Ms) avoid such challenges, preferring very easy or very hard tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional reactions:</strong> Approaching success focuses on pride feeling; avoiding failure focuses on shame feeling.</li>
                <li><strong>Achievement behaviour:</strong> Culminates in observable behaviour. High achievers seek challenging situations and persist; low achievers avoid challenges and demonstrate less persistence.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Achievement motivation in action:</strong> A high-achieving athlete seeks challenging competitions against equal-ability opponents to test skills. A low-achieving athlete might only compete in certain-win events or events so difficult that no one expects success, thus avoiding true ability tests.
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            High and low achievers are defined not by ability, but by response to challenge. Both groups want pride and minimized shame, but use different strategies.
        </div>

        <h3>C.3.2 Self-determination</h3>

        <p>
            Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is a contemporary, highly influential theory emphasizing the interaction between inner drives and external environment.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Key concepts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SDT approach:</strong> Organismic-dialectic approach emphasizing individual inner drive–external environment interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Three basic psychological needs:</strong> Autonomy, competence and relatedness.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-determination continuum:</strong> Motivation spectrum from amotivation (no motivation) to intrinsic motivation (most self-determined form).</li>
                <li><strong>Six mini-theories:</strong> Comprehensive components forming the SDT meta-theory.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>The self-determination continuum</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Amotivation:</strong> Lowest self-determination level; lack of intent to act. <em>Example: Harper has no desire for physical activity.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Extrinsic regulation:</strong> Behaviour controlled by external rewards/punishments. <em>Example: Lee walks because doctor advised.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Introjected regulation:</strong> Behaviour driven by internal pressures like guilt or avoiding disapproval. <em>Example: Student plays on school team only because parents want it.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Identified regulation:</strong> Individual consciously values behaviour and sees it as important. <em>Example: Attending aerobics because it's important to look good.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Integrated regulation:</strong> Behaviour fully assimilated with individual's sense of self and values. <em>Example: Tal is a runner getting personal satisfaction from achieving goals.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Intrinsic motivation:</strong> Highest self-determination level; behaviour performed for inherent fun and enjoyment. <em>Example: Rafa plays tennis and swims for pure fun.</em></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Autonomy-supportive coaching:</strong> A youth baseball team with coach complete control and all decision-making (controlling environment) shows lower player motivation. If the coach includes players in decision-making and gives choices (autonomy-supportive environment), players are happier, more engaged, and their autonomy, competence and relatedness needs are better met, leading to higher self-determined motivation.
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            Extrinsic motivation isn't always "bad." Moving along the continuum from extrinsic to integrated regulation, motivation becomes more autonomous and self-determined, even though technically still extrinsic.
        </div>

        <h3>C.3.3 Motivational climate</h3>

        <p>
            The psychological environment shaped by coaches, teachers and parents directly influences athlete motivation through specific, manipulable structural elements.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Key concepts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mastery (Task) climate:</strong> Environment focusing on effort, personal improvement, learning and cooperation.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance (Ego) climate:</strong> Environment focusing on social comparison, competition and outperforming others.</li>
                <li><strong>TARGET approach:</strong> Framework outlining six areas coaches/teachers can manipulate to create mastery-oriented motivational climate.</li>
                <li><strong>TEOSQ (Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire):</strong> Tool measuring individual's dispositional task- or ego-orientation tendency.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>The TARGET approach</h4>
            <p>Coaches and teachers influence motivational climate by structuring six key areas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Designing diverse, challenging, self-referenced tasks (maintaining interest, focusing on personal progress).</li>
                <li><strong>Authority:</strong> Involving students in decision-making and leadership roles (fostering autonomy).</li>
                <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> Providing private recognition for individual effort and improvement (building competence without promoting social comparison).</li>
                <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Using flexible, mixed-ability groups (emphasizing learning and cooperation over ability).</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Using self-referenced criteria based on personal improvement (focusing on mastery and effort).</li>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> Allowing flexible timing for task completion (supporting mastery, reducing anxiety).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Creating mastery climate in PE:</strong> A PE teacher improving ball-dribbling skills could create mastery climate by having students work in mixed-ability groups on self-referenced goals with private effort feedback. Creating performance climate: making the lesson a public race between ability-based groups with recognition only for winning team. The latter may encourage cheating (cutting corners) to win.
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            <strong>Examiner's note:</strong> Motivational climate questions rarely involve simple recall. Expect scenario-based problems in Papers 1B and 2 requiring TARGET framework as diagnostic and prescriptive tool. You must identify performance climate elements in scenarios and suggest specific, practical changes using TARGET principles to create mastery climate.

                    According to Self-Determination Theory, relatedness and autonomy are basic psychological needs that must be met to sustain motivation. The dropout players have lower mean relatedness score (6.58 vs 7.14), suggesting they feel less connected to teammates or coach, which undermines motivation. Their lower autonomy score (6.58 vs 6.98) suggests they feel their behaviour is being controlled and they lack choice or input into participation. When these fundamental needs are frustrated, individuals experience lower self-determined motivation and are more likely to discontinue participation, as reflected in the dropout group data.

                    According to goal orientation theory, achievement behaviour is a combination of goal orientation and perceived ability. An athlete with high ego orientation and low perceived ability in a specific moment is likely to become anxious. They're focused on demonstrating superiority, so if they fear they cannot, they'll try to protect their ego by avoiding the situation, showing less effort or not taking risks, which explains the observed behaviour.

They may also experience introjected regulation, feeling guilty about health and exercising to avoid internal pressure. Their statement that exercise is boring shows lack of intrinsic motivation. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Progression to identified regulation:</strong> Working with instructor, they might progress to identified regulation.

                    <strong>Achieving integrated/intrinsic motivation:</strong> Ideally, the client could eventually experience integrated regulation or intrinsic motivation. Integrated regulation means being an active person becomes part of their identity and aligns with core values.

                    <strong>Distinction:</strong> A task-oriented individual defines success based on self-referenced criteria. Their main goals are to master tasks, exert maximum effort and achieve personal improvement. For example, a task-oriented swimmer focuses on beating their previous personal best time. In contrast, an ego-oriented individual defines success through social comparison. Their goal is to demonstrate superior ability by outperforming others or winning with less effort. For example, an ego-oriented swimmer focuses on finishing first in the race, regardless of time. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Mastery climate benefits—positive outcomes:</strong> A coach should create a mastery motivational climate because it yields more positive motivational outcomes. This climate type emphasizes effort, learning and personal progress, leading to more positive attitude, higher satisfaction and increased intrinsic motivation. For example, when athletes are praised for hard work rather than just winning, they're more likely to persist after a loss and see failure as a learning opportunity. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Mastery climate benefits—protects motivation:</strong> Furthermore, a mastery climate protects athletes' motivation, especially those with lower perceived ability or who are ego-oriented. In an ego-involving climate, athletes doubting their ability to win may become anxious and reduce effort. In a mastery climate, they can still feel successful by trying hard and improving skills. <strong>[1 mark]</strong><br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Practical TARGET example—Recognition:</strong> A practical example of creating this climate is the coach using the Recognition element of the TARGET model by providing private, individual praise for an athlete who has mastered a new skill, rather than only publicly praising the match winner. <strong>[1 mark + 1 mark for quality]</strong>

                Students often assume ego orientation is inherently negative. While problematic if task orientation is low and perceived competence is low, high ego orientation can powerfully motivate elite athletes.

            <div class="linking-answer">
                Perceived ability is core to Need Achievement Theory and Goal Orientation Theory. High ego orientation with low perceived ability may cause unnecessary risk-taking to demonstrate competence, potentially leading to injury from poor judgement (e.g., attempting unprepared weightlifting max to impress others). Low achievement motivation may cause challenge avoidance, leading to under-preparation and higher injury risk when eventually forced into demanding situations. Lack of confidence could also lead to tentative movements and poor technique, increasing injury risk.

                Physical environment can directly impact Self-Determination Theory's three basic psychological needs. Limited or poor-quality resources (e.g., run-down gym) can frustrate the need for competence, as athletes may feel they cannot train effectively or master skills. Lack of accessible facilities can thwart autonomy by limiting choice of when and how to train. Environmental factors like extreme heat, humidity or altitude can make training feel more like a chore than enjoyable activity, undermining intrinsic motivation and pushing athlete's motivation towards the more controlling continuum end.

                How can mastery motivational climate principles (C.3.3) be applied to skill acquisition (D.4)?
            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                TARGET principles of mastery climate align directly with skill acquisition best practices. For Task, coaches could design variable practice drills with diverse challenges instead of repetitive, blocked drills, promoting adaptability. For Authority, involving athletes in decision-making about which skill to work on fosters autonomy and cognitive engagement in learning. For Evaluation, focusing on self-referenced criteria and improvement rather than public comparison reduces anxiety interfering with learning and encourages athletes to focus on skill development process. This environment supports cognitive and associative learning stages by encouraging experimentation without fear of failure.
