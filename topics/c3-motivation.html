                                        Goal orientation theory provides a robust framework for
                                        understanding motivation
                                        in
                                        achievement contexts. Strengths: (1) It effectively considers both
                                        individual
                                        disposition
                                        (an athlete's tendency toward task or ego orientation) and
                                        situational factors
                                        (the
                                        motivational climate), providing a more holistic view than
                                        personality-only
                                        theories. (2) It
                                        has strong practical applications, such as the TARGET framework,
                                        which gives
                                        coaches and
                                        teachers concrete strategies to foster a more positive and adaptive
                                        motivational
                                        climate.
                                        Limitations: (1) The theory has been criticized for potential
                                        Western and male
                                        bias, as it
                                        was developed primarily in those contexts and may not fully capture
                                        motivational
                                        dynamics in
                                        other cultures. (2) The focus on just two goal orientations (task
                                        and ego) could
                                        be seen as
                                        reductionist, as individuals may hold multiple goals simultaneously

                                        The mean ego orientation score is 3.66 (to two decimal places). The

                        <p>Achievement motivation refers to an individual's efforts to master a task,
                            achieve
                            excellence, overcome
                            obstacles, and take pride in demonstrating talent. It's the 'why' behind an
                            athlete's
                            approach to
                            competition and challenge. This sub-topic covers foundational theories that
                            explain why
                            individuals are
                            drawn to or shy away from challenging situations, focusing on the interplay
                            between
                            personality and the

                            of

                            continuum,

                            Extrinsic rewards are not always detrimental to motivation. A reward (e.g.,

                            increase intrinsic
                            motivation.
                            However, a reward (e.g., money for winning) that is perceived as controlling the
                            athlete's
                            behaviour is
                            likely to undermine and decrease intrinsic motivation.

                        <p>The motivational climate is the psychological environment engineered by a coach,
                            teacher, or
                            parent. This
                            climate is not accidental; it is a direct result of the values that are
                            emphasized, the way
                            success is
                            defined, and how feedback is delivered. This climate plays a powerful role in
                            determining
                            whether
                            athletes adopt a task (mastery) or ego (performance) orientation, which in turn
                            affects
                            their behaviour,
                            effort, and enjoyment.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mastery Climate (Task-Involving):</strong> An environment where the
                                focus is on
                                effort,
                                personal improvement, skill development, and cooperation. Success is
                                self-referenced and
                                defined by
                                learning and working hard.</li>
                            <li><strong>Performance Climate (Ego-Involving):</strong> An environment where
                                the focus is
                                on social
                                comparison, outperforming others, and winning with minimal effort. Success
                                is
                                norm-referenced and
                                defined by being better than others.</li>
                            <li><strong>The TARGET Approach:</strong> A practical framework outlining six
                                distinct areas
                                (Task,
                                Authority, Recognition, Grouping, Evaluation, Time) that leaders can
                                manipulate to
                                create a more
                                mastery-oriented motivational climate.</li>

                                <li><strong>Task:</strong> The coach designs a variety of tasks that
                                    challenge all
                                    players at their

                                <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> The coach provides private and individual

                                    for effort,

                                <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Players are placed in mixed-ability groups to

                                    peer

                                    mastery of
                                    skills, and
                                    effort, rather than on comparison to teammates.</li>

                            teacher wants
                            to create a

                            A mastery/task climate is strongly associated with positive outcomes like

                                        correction and skill development. In a performance climate, feedback

                                    <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Skill acquisition is rarely linear and
                                        requires
                                        persistence
                                        through performance plateaus. A mastery climate fosters this
                                        persistence by
                                        defining success
                                        as effort and improvement, motivating athletes to continue
                                        practicing even when
                                        progress is
                                        slow.</li>
