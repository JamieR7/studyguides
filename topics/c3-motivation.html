        <h1>🧠 Topic C.3: Motivation</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.15rem;color:#666;margin-bottom:2rem;">
            As the Lead Examiner for the 2026 syllabus transition, I have designed this guide to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and the rigorous demands of the new assessment model. Motivation is not merely "wanting to win"; it is a complex psychological construct that dictates athlete persistence, learning, and long-term participation. In the IB Sports, Exercise and Health Science (SEHS) course, success in Topic C.3 requires more than a casual understanding—it demands the precise application of terminology and the ability to evaluate behavioral outcomes within specific sporting contexts.

        <p>
            In Paper 1 and 2, the markscheme rewards the exact terminology found in the syllabus. Precise definitions are the foundation of scoring; mislabeling a construct (e.g., using "self-drive" instead of "intrinsic motivation") will result in lost marks.

                High ego orientation leads to anxiety when the athlete also has low perceived ability. Because their success is defined by outperforming others, they perceive the situation as a threat to their self-worth when they believe they lack the skill to win, leading to increased stress and avoidance behaviors (p.500, 520).

        <h2>Content summary</h2>

        <h3>C.3.1 Achievement Motivation</h3>

        <p>
            Achievement motivation is the interaction between personality (Motive to achieve success vs. avoid failure) and the environment (p.496).
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>
                Personality Factors + Situational Factors (Probability of success/Incentive value) \( \rightarrow \) Resultant Tendency \( \rightarrow \) Emotional Reactions \( \rightarrow \) Achievement Behavior (p.496).
            </p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Achievers:</strong> Select challenging tasks, display high effort, and focus on the pride of success.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Achievers:</strong> Avoid challenges, opting for tasks that are either extremely easy (guaranteed success) or extremely difficult (failure is not shameful because it was expected) (p.496).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            In swimming, an individual sport where success is highly visible, a low achiever may avoid racing a peer of similar ability to avoid the risk of public failure and subsequent shame (p.501).
        </div>

        <h3>C.3.2 Self-Determination Theory (SDT)</h3>

        <p>
            SDT focuses on the quality of motivation and the satisfaction of psychological needs (p.505).

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Evaluation Theory:</strong> Focuses on how external events (rewards) affect intrinsic motivation via competence and autonomy.</li>
            <li><strong>Organismic Integration Theory:</strong> Describes the extrinsic motivation continuum.</li>
            <li><strong>Causality Orientations Theory:</strong> Individual differences in tendencies toward autonomy or control.</li>

        <h3>C.3.3 Motivational Climate</h3>

        <p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mastery Climate:</strong> Success is defined by personal progress (Task-oriented).</li>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>The TARGET Approach</h4>
            <p>
                Coaches manipulate Task (differentiation), Authority (leadership roles), Recognition (private), Grouping (mixed-ability), Evaluation (self-referenced), and Time (flexibility) to foster a mastery climate (p.519).
            </p>

            <div class="error-explanation">
                Task orientation is a trait (how you define success), while intrinsic motivation is a state/type of motivation (why you do it).

        <div class="error-card">
            <div class="error-title">Amotivation Misconception</div>
            <div class="error-explanation">
                Students often describe this as "low motivation." Correctly, it is the absence of intent or drive (p.511).

            <div class="error-explanation">
                Assuming high ego orientation is always negative. Correction: High ego orientation is beneficial if paired with high task orientation and high perceived ability (p.500, 521).

            <div class="error-explanation">
                Relatedness is a psychological need for belonging and acceptance, not just "having friends" or being chatty (p.505).

            <div class="linking-answer">
                <strong>Thinking Points:</strong> Personality (P) provides the motive to succeed/avoid failure, while the Environment (E) provides the probability of success. Interaction determines the "Resultant Tendency" (p.420, 496).

            <div class="linking-answer">
                <strong>Thinking Points:</strong> In an ego-climate, success is comparative. If an athlete's perceived ability is low, they feel a threat to their self-esteem, which induces high arousal and cognitive anxiety (p.520).
