                        The sliding filament theory explains that muscle contraction occurs when thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments slide past one another. This sliding action shortens the sarcomere, the functional unit of the muscle, while the filaments themselves remain at a relatively constant length. The mechanism is driven by the formation of cross-bridges, where myosin heads bind to actin, generating filament movement.

                    <div class="model-answer-content" id="answer-q2">
                        EPOC refers to the continued elevation of oxygen consumption after exercise has concluded. It occurs as the body works to restore homeostasis by repaying the oxygen deficit, which is the gap between the oxygen required during exercise and the amount actually available at the onset of activity. This initial deficit forces the body to rely on anaerobic metabolism.

                    <p>According to the provided data table, what is the relationship between an individual's body mass, their oxygen consumption, and their energy expenditure during activity?</p>

                        The data indicates a direct, positive relationship between these variables. As body mass increases, both the absolute oxygen consumption (measured in l min⁻¹) and the absolute energy expenditure (measured in kJ hr⁻¹) also increase for a given MET value. For example, at 10 METs, a 90 kg individual consumes more oxygen (3.15 l min⁻¹) and expends more energy (3,766 kJ hr⁻¹) than a 70 kg individual (2.45 l min⁻¹ and 2,929 kJ hr⁻¹).

                        Traditionally, fatigue was categorized as either central fatigue (occurring proximal to the neuromuscular junction, in the brain or spinal cord) or peripheral fatigue (occurring distal to the neuromuscular junction, within the muscle itself). This model is considered too reductionist because it does not reflect the true, holistic physiology of the body. Recent research views fatigue as a symptom and aims to investigate it on a more global scale.

                        The fast component, or alactacid debt, occurs immediately post-exercise for about 2-3 minutes and is primarily responsible for replenishing ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) stores and restoring oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin. The slow component, or lactacid debt, can last for minutes to hours and involves processes like lactate metabolism, reducing elevated body temperature, tissue repair, and glycogen resynthesis.

                    <div class="model-answer-content" id="answer-q6">
                        An accumulation of Pi from ATP hydrolysis impairs contraction by interfering with the power stroke of the myosin head; a high concentration of Pi makes it less likely for the phosphate to detach from myosin, which is a necessary step for contraction to occur. Additionally, excess phosphate can bind with calcium to form a precipitate, reducing the amount of free calcium available to initiate contraction by binding to the troponin-tropomyosin complex.

                        The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a modified endoplasmic reticulum that acts as an intracellular store for calcium (Ca²⁺), which it can rapidly release to initiate contraction and sequester to allow for relaxation. The transverse (T)-tubules are invaginations of the muscle's surface membrane (sarcolemma) that relay action potentials deep into the myocyte, triggering the SR to release its stored calcium.

                        Creatine supplementation may improve recovery from intensive exercise by speeding up recovery time between bouts, mitigating muscle damage, and promoting faster recovery of lost force production. It appears to positively influence recovery from intense activity and can help attenuate muscle damage and soreness. While some studies show no improvement, at worst, creatine supplementation has been shown to maintain exercise performance.

                        Lactic acid is not directly related to fatigue because the body produces lactate, not lactic acid, during energy metabolism, and lactate does not release a proton to make its environment acidic. In fact, lactate production is beneficial as it can reduce acidosis within the muscle and serves as an important fuel source during and after sport. Evidence suggests lactate's contribution to performance decrement is no more than about 5%.

                        Jet lag occurs after rapid travel across three or more time zones, causing a loss of synchrony between the internal body clock (circadian rhythms) and the new destination time. This leads to symptoms like sleep disruption, daytime fatigue, and reduced performance. Post-travel recommendations include sleeping in a cool (18-20°C) and quiet environment, scheduling a 20- to 40-minute daytime nap, and rehydrating while avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon or evening.

                        <td>The SR Ca²⁺ release channel. It is activated by the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the T-tubule, allowing Ca²⁺ to be released into the cytosol to initiate contraction.</td>

                        <td>The accepted explanation for muscle contraction, stating that myosin (thick) filaments slide past actin (thin) filaments, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments themselves do not change in length.</td>

                        <td>A regulatory protein complex attached to tropomyosin. When calcium binds to troponin, it causes a conformational change that moves tropomyosin, exposing the myosin-binding sites on actin and allowing contraction to begin.</td>
