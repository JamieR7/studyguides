                    Topic C.5,
                    Psychological Skills, as detailed in the IB SEHS 2026 syllabus. The content is organized

                    with
                    the syllabus, distinguishing between concepts required for all students and those
                    exclusive to

                    Level.</p>

                <h3>C.5.1 Goal Setting (SL/HL)</h3>
                <p>Goal setting is a fundamental psychological skill used to direct an individual's
                    attention and effort
                    towards a specific objective. In sport, exercise, and health, it is a powerful tool for
                    enhancing
                    motivation, providing feedback, and supporting long-term adherence to a training or
                    activity
                    program.
                </p>

                <p>The key concepts in goal setting are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Outcome goals <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                    <li>Performance goals <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                    <li>Process goals <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>These different goal types work together to influence an athlete's focus and motivation
                    through the
                    following mechanism:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Outcome goals</strong> provide the ultimate direction and long-term vision
                        (e.g.,
                        winning a
                        championship). However, as they are often dependent on the performance of others,
                        they are not
                        entirely within an individual's control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance goals</strong> shift the focus to achieving a self-referenced
                        standard
                        (e.g., a
                        personal best time). This increases an individual's sense of control and allows for
                        more
                        objective
                        measurement of progress, independent of opponents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process goals</strong> are the most controllable, as they direct attention
                        to the
                        specific
                        actions, techniques, or strategies required to execute a skill effectively. They are
                        the
                        building
                        blocks that lead to the achievement of performance and outcome goals.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="real-world-example">
                    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    A basketball player aiming to improve their free-throw shooting could use a combination
                    of
                    goals:<br>
                    <strong>Outcome Goal:</strong> To have the highest free-throw percentage in the
                    league.<br>
                    <strong>Performance Goal:</strong> To achieve a free-throw percentage of 85% for the
                    season.<br>
                    <strong>Process Goal:</strong> To bend their knees, keep their elbow tucked in, and
                    follow through
                    on
                    every shot.

                    <strong>NOTE:</strong><br>
                    The effectiveness of each goal type depends on the individual and their achievement
                    motivation. Some
                    athletes are highly driven by norm-referenced outcome goals, while others perform better
                    when
                    focusing
                    entirely on self-referenced performance and process goals. <span class="page-ref">p.50</span>

                <h3>C.5.1.2 Goal Setting (HL Only)</h3>
                <p>For Higher Level students, the study of goal setting becomes more nuanced, exploring the
                    potential
                    downsides and the critical importance of flexibility. This includes understanding
                    paradoxical
                    effects on
                    elite performers and the necessity of adjusting goals in dynamic performance
                    environments.</p>

                <p>Key HL concepts include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The goal-setting paradox <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                    <li>Goal adjustment <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                    <li>"Do-your-best" or "open" goals <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>The goal-setting paradox describes a counterintuitive psychological response sometimes
                    seen in elite
                    athletes. The mechanism is as follows:</p>

                <div class="mechanism-steps">
                    <ol>
                        <li>An athlete sets an extremely high, long-term goal that requires immense
                            dedication and
                            sacrifice
                            to achieve.</li>
                        <li>Upon finally achieving this pinnacle goal, instead of pure elation, they may
                            experience
                            feelings
                            of deflation, emptiness, or a loss of purpose.</li>
                        <li>This is because the entire process was focused on the destination, and once
                            reached, the
                            journey
                            and its driving motivation are abruptly over. This highlights why goal
                            adjustment and
                            setting
                            new goals are critical for sustained well-being.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="real-world-example">
                    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    Consider an elite marathon runner who sets a performance goal of a sub-2:15:00 time. On
                    race day,
                    they
                    encounter unexpectedly strong headwinds. Instead of rigidly sticking to their initial
                    pace, which
                    could
                    lead to burnout, they engage in goal adjustment. Mid-race, they shift their focus to a
                    process goal
                    of
                    maintaining a specific effort level (e.g., heart rate zone) and adjust their performance
                    goal to
                    finishing in the top five, demonstrating the adaptive nature required at the elite
                    level.

                    <strong>TIP:</strong><br>
                    While structured goal setting is widely promoted, it is important to recognize that it
                    is not a
                    panacea.
                    Research suggests that for certain tasks or individuals, less rigid "do-your-best" goals
                    or "open"
                    goals
                    (which have no predefined endpoint) can lead to superior performance and creativity.

                <h3>C.5.2 Imagery (HL Only)</h3>
                <p>Imagery, often referred to as visualization or mental rehearsal, is a cognitive process
                    that mimics a
                    real experience. It is a powerful psychological skill that involves using a combination
                    of sensory
                    modalities (sight, sound, touch, etc.) in the absence of actual perception. In sport, it
                    serves two
                    primary functions: a cognitive function (to rehearse skills and strategies) and a
                    motivational
                    function
                    (to manage arousal and build confidence).</p>

                <p>Key concepts in imagery include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cognitive and motivational functions <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                    <li>The PETTLEP model <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                    <li>Paivio's imagery framework <span class="page-ref">p.50</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>To be effective, imagery must be more than simple daydreaming. The PETTLEP model provides
                    a framework
                    for
                    creating a vivid and realistic mental script that is functionally equivalent to the
                    actual
                    performance.
                    Each element contributes to this equivalence:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical:</strong> The imager should adopt the physical stance and wear the
                        same attire
                        as
                        in the performance environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environment:</strong> The imager should visualize the specific competition
                        venue,
                        including
                        the sights, sounds, and textures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task:</strong> The content of the imagery should be identical in its demands
                        and focus
                        to
                        the actual task being performed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> The imagery should be conducted in real-time, taking the
                        same duration
                        as
                        the actual skill or performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learning:</strong> The imagery content should be adapted as the athlete's
                        skill level
                        and
                        needs change over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emotion:</strong> The imager should attach the emotions and feelings that
                        would be
                        associated with the real performance (e.g., confidence, determination, managing
                        anxiety).</li>
                    <li><strong>Perspective:</strong> The imager can switch between an internal
                        (first-person) and
                        external
                        (third-person) perspective, depending on what is most effective for the task.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="real-world-example">
                    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    A gymnast preparing for a major competition could use the PETTLEP model to mentally
                    rehearse their
                    floor
                    routine. They would sit quietly in their competition leotard (Physical), vividly
                    imagining the
                    specific
                    arena, the crowd noise, and the feel of the floor (Environment). They would mentally
                    perform the
                    exact
                    sequence of tumbles and dance elements (Task) in the same 1 minute and 30 seconds it

                    Imagery is fundamentally about creating a multi-sensory experience within the mind.
                    Effective
                    imagery
                    engages not just the visual sense but also auditory (hearing the crowd), kinesthetic
                    (feeling the
                    muscle
                    contractions), and emotional systems, all without any external stimuli. <span

                            The methodology has several significant limitations that weaken the conclusion.
                            Firstly,
                            there
                            was no control group; without a group of gymnasts who did not use the imagery
                            intervention,
                            it
                            is impossible to determine if the improvement was due to the PETTLEP model or
                            other factors
                            like
                            normal training progression or a placebo effect. Secondly, the sample size of
                            ten gymnasts
                            is
                            very small, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Thirdly, the use
                            of a single
                            coach's subjective rating for performance is a potential source of bias; the

                            expected to see an improvement, influencing their scores. A more robust design
                            would have
                            included a control group, a larger sample size, and blinded, independent judges
                            to score the

                            influenced by many factors and may not change quickly, which can be discouraging

                            The exclusive focus on an outcome goal ("to win every tournament") is likely
                            contributing to
                            her
                            anxiety because winning is not entirely within her control; it also depends on
                            the
                            opponent's
                            performance and other external factors. This lack of complete control can lead
                            to feelings
                            of
                            pressure and anxiety.<br><br>
                            A coach could implement performance and process goals to help. First, a
                            performance goal,
                            such
                            as "achieving a first-serve percentage of 60% in the match," would shift her
                            focus to a
                            measurable, self-referenced target that is independent of winning or losing.
                            Second, a
                            process
                            goal, such as "watching the ball onto the strings for every shot," would direct
                            her
                            attention to
                            a specific, controllable technical element of her game. By focusing on these
                            controllable
                            goals,
                            her attention is diverted from the high-pressure outcome, reducing anxiety and
                            allowing her
                            to
                            concentrate on the actions that will ultimately lead to better performance.

                            the

                <p>Awareness of common misconceptions and errors is a key step towards avoiding them in your
                    own work. Since the source context does not provide specific examples of documented student errors
                    for
                    Topic C.5, this section outlines potential areas of confusion based on the syllabus content.</p>

                <div class="error-card">
                    <div class="error-title">Confusing Outcome and Performance Goals</div>
                    <div class="error-explanation">A common mistake is to misclassify goals. Remember that
                        if the goal's success depends on the performance of others (e.g., winning), it is an outcome
                        goal.
                        If it is a self-referenced, measurable standard (e.g., personal best time), it is a performance
                        goal.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="error-card">
                    <div class="error-title">Treating Imagery as Simple Daydreaming</div>
                    <div class="error-explanation">A weak understanding of imagery is to see it as just
                        "thinking about" the sport. Elite use of imagery is a structured, multi-sensory process, as
                        detailed in
                        the PETTLEP model, designed to be functionally equivalent to performance.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="error-card">
                    <div class="error-title">Ignoring Individual Differences in Goal Setting</div>
                    <div class="error-explanation">Stating that a specific goal-setting strategy is "best"
                        without qualification is an error. The syllabus notes that effectiveness depends on the
                        individual and their achievement motivation.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="error-card">
                    <div class="error-title">Misunderstanding the Goal-Setting Paradox (HL)</div>
                    <div class="error-explanation">This paradox is not about failure but about the
                        psychological response to success. It describes deflation after achieving a major goal, not
                        anxiety before it.

                </div>

                <div class="error-card">
                    <div class="error-title">Neglecting Goal Adjustment (HL)</div>
                    <div class="error-explanation">Focusing only on the initial act of goal setting is a
                        limited view. At an elite level, the ability to flexibly adjust goals in response to changing
                        circumstances (e.g., weather, injury, opponent's strategy) is often more critical.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="error-card">
                    <div class="error-title">Applying Imagery without Functional Equivalence (HL)</div>
                    <div class="error-explanation">Describing imagery without referencing the principles
                        that make it effective (like those in the PETTLEP model) demonstrates a superficial
                        understanding. The key is how closely the imagery mimics reality.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="error-card">
                    <div class="error-title">Failing to Distinguish Imagery Functions (HL)</div>
                    <div class="error-explanation">A nuanced answer must differentiate between the cognitive
                        purpose of imagery (skill/strategy rehearsal) and its motivational purpose (confidence/arousal
                        regulation), as outlined in Paivio's framework.</div>
