                    <strong>A:</strong> During knee extension, the quadriceps act as the agonist and contract to extend the joint. Reciprocal inhibition involves the nervous system sending inhibitory signals to the hamstrings, causing them to relax so they do not oppose the quadriceps, allowing smooth, efficient extension.

                    <strong>A:</strong> The elbow acts as a Class 3 lever where the fulcrum is the elbow joint, the effort is applied by the biceps brachii on the radius between the fulcrum and the load, and the load is the weight in the hand. This arrangement produces a mechanical disadvantage but allows large, fast movements of the hand.

                    <strong>Q:</strong> Evaluate the use of Class 3 levers for human movement.<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Class 3 levers allow a large range and speed of movement at the distal segment, which benefits actions such as throwing or kicking, but they have a mechanical disadvantage because the effort arm is shorter than the load arm, so muscles must generate forces greater than the load and are less efficient for moving heavy objects.

        <!-- 4. CONTENT SUMMARY -->
        <span class="section-badge">📖 Section 4</span>
        <h2>Content summary: generating movement</h2>

        <h3>B.1.1 Anatomical position, planes and movement</h3>

        <p>
            This subtopic defines the standard reference position and the planes and axes used to describe movement precisely in sport and exercise.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Anatomical foundations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The skeleton is divided into the axial skeleton, which mainly protects vital organs, and the appendicular skeleton, which primarily enables movement.</li>
                <li>Positional terminology such as superior/inferior, proximal/distal and anterior/posterior provides a standardized way to describe relative locations of body parts.</li>
                <li>Movements occur in three main planes (sagittal, frontal, transverse) and about corresponding axes; terms like flexion, extension, abduction and adduction specify the joint actions occurring in each plane.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            In a tennis serve, elbow and wrist flexion–extension occur in the sagittal plane, abduction of the serving arm occurs in the frontal plane, and trunk rotation to generate power takes place in the transverse plane. Using this terminology, a coach can break down the skill and give precise technical feedback.
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            Be prepared to label or describe movements in unfamiliar sport images. Practise naming the plane, axis and specific joint actions for skills across different sports.
        </div>

        <h3>B.1.2 Structure and function of connective tissues and joints</h3>

        <p>
            Movement depends on the interaction of bones, connective tissues and joints, which balance mobility with stability.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Connective tissues and joints</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bone, ligaments, cartilage, fascia and tendons have distinct structures that either stabilize joints or permit movement.</li>
                <li>Joints are classified as fibrous (immovable), cartilaginous (slightly movable) and synovial (freely movable), each reflecting a different balance between stability and mobility.</li>
                <li>Synovial joints, such as ball‑and‑socket and hinge joints, contain features like articular cartilage, synovial fluid and a capsule that allow extensive movement with low friction.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            The knee joint acts as a synovial hinge joint: articular cartilage reduces friction, ligaments such as the ACL and PCL provide stability, and tendons like the quadriceps tendon transmit muscle force to move the tibia during running and jumping.
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            When comparing joint types, always link structure to function, for example how the deep socket and strong ligaments of the hip sacrifice range of motion in favour of stability.
        </div>

        <h3>B.1.3 Muscular function</h3>

        <p>
            Muscles are the active force generators that move and stabilise the skeleton via motor unit recruitment and different contraction types.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Motor units and contractions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A motor unit is a motor neuron and its muscle fibres; once threshold is reached, all fibres in that unit contract maximally according to the all‑or‑none principle.</li>
                <li>Motor units vary by fibre type (Type I, IIa, IIx) and are recruited according to the size principle, with smaller fatigue‑resistant units activated first as force demands increase.</li>
                <li>Muscle contractions include isometric (no change in length), isotonic concentric (shortening), isotonic eccentric (lengthening under tension) and isokinetic (constant speed, specialized equipment).</li>
                <li>Agonist and antagonist muscle pairs coordinate movement through reciprocal inhibition, where the antagonist relaxes as the agonist contracts.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            In a squat, the quadriceps perform an eccentric contraction during the lowering phase to control descent, an isometric contraction when holding at the bottom, and a concentric contraction during the upward phase to extend the knees and stand.
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            In exam answers, always specify both the contraction type (concentric or eccentric) and whether the muscle is acting as agonist or antagonist in the particular movement described.
        </div>

        <h3>B.1.3 (HL) Sliding filament theory</h3>

        <p>
            Higher level students must explain how interactions within the sarcomere convert chemical energy from ATP into force and movement.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Sliding filament mechanism (HL)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>A nerve impulse reaches the neuromuscular junction, triggering calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle fibre.</li>
                <li>Calcium binds to troponin, causing tropomyosin to move away from active sites on actin and exposing them.</li>
                <li>Energized myosin heads attach to the exposed actin binding sites, forming cross‑bridges.</li>
                <li>ATP hydrolysis powers the myosin heads to pivot, pulling actin towards the centre of the sarcomere in a power stroke and shortening the sarcomere.</li>
                <li>A new ATP molecule binds to myosin, causing it to detach from actin before being re‑energized to repeat the cycle while calcium and ATP remain available.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            In a fatigued marathon runner, depleted ATP and disrupted calcium handling slow cross‑bridge cycling and reduce the number of active cross‑bridges, leading to reduced force production and sensations of muscular stiffness.
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            When explaining the sliding filament theory, explicitly mention the roles of calcium, ATP, actin, myosin, troponin and tropomyosin in a logical sequence.
        </div>

        <h3>B.1.4 Levers in movement and sport</h3>

        <p>
            The musculoskeletal system operates as a set of levers where bones are rigid bars, joints are fulcrums and muscles provide effort to move loads.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Lever classes and mechanical advantage</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Levers are classified by the relative positions of fulcrum (F), effort (E) and load (L): Class 1 (E‑F‑L or L‑F‑E), Class 2 (F‑L‑E) and Class 3 (F‑E‑L).</li>
                <li>Class 1 levers, such as nodding the head, can provide either a mechanical advantage or disadvantage depending on fulcrum position.</li>
                <li>Class 2 levers, such as a calf raise, place the load between fulcrum and effort and always provide a mechanical advantage (&gt;1) for force production.</li>
                <li>Class 3 levers, such as the elbow during a bicep curl, place the effort between fulcrum and load, producing a mechanical disadvantage (&lt;1) but allowing large, fast movements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            In rowing, the oar acts as a Class 1 external lever with the oarlock as fulcrum, the rower’s hands applying effort and the water resistance acting as load; adjusting grip and oar length changes the effective mechanical advantage.
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            For any lever question, first identify the fulcrum, effort and load, then state the lever class and whether it provides mechanical advantage or disadvantage.
        </div>

                    The triceps brachii acts as the agonist controlling elbow extension and lengthens under tension to control the descent, which is an isotonic eccentric contraction; concentric action occurs in the upward phase.

        <span class="section-badge">🔢 Section 6</span>
        <h2>Mathematical skills</h2>

        <p>
            For Topic B.1, the key quantitative skill is calculating mechanical advantage for lever systems in order to judge whether a lever favours force or speed.
        </p>

        <div class="formula-box">
            Mechanical advantage = Length of effort arm ÷ Length of load arm
        </div>

        <div class="working-steps">
            <h4>Worked example</h4>
            <p>
                A lifter performs a bicep curl with a 15 kg dumbbell. Effort is applied 4 cm from the elbow (fulcrum) and the load is 28 cm from the fulcrum.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Effort arm = 4 cm; load arm = 28 cm.</li>
                <li>MA = 4 ÷ 28.</li>
                <li>MA = 0.143 (no units).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                An MA less than 1 indicates mechanical disadvantage, typical of Class 3 levers that prioritise speed and range of motion.

            <div class="error-explanation">
                Tendons connect muscle to bone and transmit force, whereas ligaments connect bone to bone and stabilise joints; confusing them leads to inaccurate explanations of injuries.

            <div class="linking-answer">
                Inadequate carbohydrate and fat intake limits ATP resynthesis needed for cross‑bridge cycling, while deficiencies in micronutrients such as calcium and electrolytes disrupt excitation–contraction coupling and nerve transmission, reducing force output and increasing fatigue.

            <div class="linking-answer">
                During the cognitive stage of motor learning, instructions like “increase knee flexion” or “fully extend the elbow” give clear, unambiguous cues that help learners build accurate movement schemas and progress more quickly to the associative stage.

                Modifying external levers, such as using a shorter, lighter tennis racket, reduces required torque and rotational inertia so learners can focus on technique; as skill improves, lever length can be increased to match performance demands.
