            <p>Knowing the structure is the first step; the next is to understand the specific language used in the exam questions, known as command terms, which dictate the type of response required.</p>

            <h2>Command Terms for Topic B2</h2>
            <p>Command terms are the instructional verbs used in IB exam questions, such as "Explain," "Describe," or "Calculate." Each term requires a different level of detail and a specific type of response. Mastering their meaning is essential for understanding what is being asked of you and, consequently, for maximizing your marks on every question.</p>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <h4>State</h4>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> State the principle of conservation of angular momentum.</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> A rotating body will continue to turn about its axis with constant angular momentum unless an external unbalanced torque is applied to it <span class="page-ref">p.322</span>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <h4>Outline</h4>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Outline the factors affecting the stability of an object.</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> The three main factors affecting stability are the height of the centre of mass relative to the supporting surface, the size of the base of support, and the position of the line of gravity relative to the base of support <span class="page-ref">p.318</span>. A lower centre of mass, larger base of support, and a line of gravity within the base of support all provide greater stability <span class="page-ref">p.318</span>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <h4>Describe</h4>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Describe the relationship between applied force and frictional force for an object starting from rest.</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> As an applied force is first exerted on a stationary object, the force of static friction increases to match it, and the object does not move. The maximum value of static friction is reached just before the object begins to move. Once the object is in motion, the friction acting on it is dynamic friction, which is lower than the maximum static friction and remains constant as long as the object is moving <span class="page-ref">p.328</span>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <h4>Explain</h4>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Explain how a swimmer can increase their rate of rotation during a somersault turn.</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> According to the principle of conservation of angular momentum, the swimmer's angular momentum remains constant while airborne. Angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity (L = Iω). By "tucking" their body (bringing their arms and legs towards the centre of gravity), the swimmer decreases their moment of inertia. To keep the total angular momentum constant, their angular velocity must increase, resulting in a faster rate of rotation <span class="page-ref">p.323</span>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <h4>Analyse</h4>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Analyse the data in Figure 13 <span class="page-ref">p.324</span> showing the angular momentum of different body parts during a piked dive.</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> The graph shows that the total angular momentum (L Total) of the diver remains constant throughout the airborne phase, demonstrating the principle of conservation of angular momentum. However, there is a transfer of angular momentum between the upper body and the legs. From 0 to 0.5 seconds, as the diver flexes their hips into the piked position, the angular velocity of the upper body increases, and its angular momentum increases. Concurrently, the angular momentum of the lower body decreases to keep the total constant. After 0.5 seconds, the process reverses as the diver prepares for entry into the water <span class="page-ref">p.324</span>.</p>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <h4>Evaluate</h4>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Evaluate the technique of drafting behind other competitors to improve performance in a cycling race.</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Drafting is a common tactic with significant strengths and limitations.</p>
                <p>Strength 1: The primary strength is a significant reduction in drag force. Athletes travelling in groups experience reduced form drag, as shown by Eliud Kipchoge's marathon attempt where pacers reduced his drag <span class="page-ref">p.349</span>. This leads to considerable energy conservation.</p>
                <p>Strength 2: Conserving energy by drafting allows a cyclist to maintain a higher speed for longer or save energy for a final sprint at the end of the race.</p>
                <p>Limitation 1: A major limitation is dependency on other athletes. The effectiveness of the draft is controlled by the speed and formation of the group, which the drafting cyclist may not be able to influence.</p>
                <p>Limitation 2: There can be an increased risk of accidents. Cycling in close proximity to other riders requires high levels of skill and concentration, and a mistake by one rider can cause a crash involving many others.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <h4>Calculate</h4>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Using the data from Table 3 <span class="page-ref">p.333</span>, calculate Usain Bolt's average velocity between the 60 m and 70 m marks of his 100m race.</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong></p>
                <p>Formula: Average velocity (v) = change in displacement (Δs) / change in time (Δt) <span class="page-ref">p.311</span>.</p>
                <p>Working:</p>
                <p>Displacement at 70 m = 70.0 m. Time at 70 m = 7.10 s.</p>
                <p>Displacement at 60 m = 60.0 m. Time at 60 m = 6.29 s.</p>
                <p>Δs = 70.0 - 60.0 = 10.0 m.</p>
                <p>Δt = 7.10 - 6.29 = 0.81 s.</p>
                <p>v = 10.0 m / 0.81 s = 12.35 m s⁻¹.</p>
                <p>Answer: The average velocity is 12.35 m s⁻¹.</p>

            <p>Understanding command terms is the first step; the next is to build a solid foundation of knowledge across the core content of the topic.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 4 -->
            <span class="section-badge">📖 Section 4</span>
            <h2>Content Summary</h2>
            <p>Topic B2 is divided into three key areas: Newton's foundational laws that govern all motion, the interaction of athletes with fluids like air and water, and the systematic analysis of movement patterns to enhance performance. This section will deconstruct each area to build a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics of sport and exercise.</p>

            <h3>B2.1 Newton's Laws of Motion</h3>
            <p>Sir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion are the bedrock of biomechanics. They provide a complete framework for understanding how forces create, change, and control movement in all sporting contexts, from the explosive start of a sprinter to the stability of a wrestler.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Kinematics is the study of motion, including linear and angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration <span class="page-ref">p.309-313</span>.</li>
                <li>Newton's first law (Inertia): Bodies or objects stay at rest or in motion unless acted on by an unbalanced force <span class="page-ref">p.315</span>.</li>
                <li>Newton's second law (Acceleration): The acceleration of a body is proportional to the force causing it and in the same direction (F=ma) <span class="page-ref">p.315-316</span>.</li>
                <li>Newton's third law (Action-Reaction): For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction <span class="page-ref">p.316</span>.</li>
                <li>Impulse is the change in momentum of an object (J = FΔt) and is critical for understanding how forces are applied over time <span class="page-ref">p.319</span>.</li>
                <li>Conservation of angular momentum states that angular momentum remains constant in the absence of an external torque, allowing athletes to control their rotation <span class="page-ref">p.322</span>.</li>
                <li>Friction is a force that acts between two surfaces in contact and can be static (not moving) or dynamic (moving) <span class="page-ref">p.327-328</span>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To illustrate how Newton's Third Law works in sprinting:</p>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> A sprinter pushes backwards and downwards with large forces onto the starting blocks <span class="page-ref">p.316</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reaction:</strong> According to Newton's third law, the blocks will push back on the sprinter with the same force, but in the opposite direction (forwards and upwards) <span class="page-ref">p.316</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> This reaction force is what propels the athlete out of the blocks and forwards down the track.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Example: The Volleyball Spike.</strong><br>
                To maximize the power of a spike, a player uses the principle of summing joint forces. They sequentially generate force from their legs, torso, shoulder, and arm, culminating in a high velocity at the hand. This is an application of Newton's second law, where the combined force results in a massive acceleration of the ball <span class="page-ref">p.319</span>.
            </div>

            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>NOTE: Mass vs. Weight.</strong><br>
                It is crucial not to confuse mass and weight. Mass is the amount of material in an object (measured in kg) and is constant. Weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass (Fg = mg) and changes depending on the gravitational field <span class="page-ref">p.315</span>.
            </div>

            <h3>B2.2 Fluid Mechanics</h3>
            <p>Once an athlete or object is in motion, they must contend with forces from the surrounding fluid (air or water). This section analyzes how these forces—drag, lift, and buoyancy—affect performance and how athletes have developed techniques and technologies to manipulate them for a competitive advantage.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Projectile motion refers to the movement of an object projected into the air, influenced only by gravity and air resistance <span class="page-ref">p.334</span>.</li>
                <li>The path of a projectile depends on its initial velocity, angle of projection, and height of release <span class="page-ref">p.335</span>.</li>
                <li>Drag is a resistive force composed of surface drag (friction) and form drag (pressure), which athletes try to minimize <span class="page-ref">p.343-345</span>.</li>
                <li>Bernoulli's principle states that the pressure exerted by a fluid is inversely related to its velocity, which is the mechanism for generating lift <span class="page-ref">p.350</span>.</li>
                <li>The Magnus effect describes how the spin of an object creates a pressure differential, causing the object's flight path to curve <span class="page-ref">p.352</span>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To illustrate how the Magnus Effect works on a spinning ball:</p>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Spin:</strong> A player imparts topspin, backspin, or sidespin to a ball as it is kicked or struck.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fluid Velocity:</strong> The side of the ball spinning in the same direction as the oncoming air drags a layer of air with it, increasing the fluid velocity on that side. On the opposite side, the surface moves against the airflow, slowing the fluid velocity <span class="page-ref">p.352</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure Differential:</strong> According to Bernoulli's principle, the area of higher fluid velocity experiences lower pressure, while the area of lower fluid velocity has higher pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Force Generation:</strong> This pressure difference creates a net force (the Magnus force) that pushes the ball from the high-pressure zone to the low-pressure zone, causing it to swerve or dip in flight <span class="page-ref">p.352</span>.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Example: Streamlining in Cycling.</strong><br>
                A competitive cyclist adopts a low, tucked position on their bike to reduce their frontal area. This minimizes form drag, which is the primary resistive force at high speeds. By making their body shape more streamlined, air flows more smoothly around them, reducing the low-pressure "wake" behind them and allowing them to travel faster for the same energy expenditure <span class="page-ref">p.345, 354</span>.
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>TIP: Optimal Projection Angle.</strong><br>
                The theoretical optimal angle of projection to maximize range is 45°. However, in sports, this is rarely the case. For events like the shot put, where the release height is above the landing height, the optimal angle is lower (e.g., 35-42°) <span class="page-ref">p.336-337</span>.
            </div>

            <h3>B2.3 Movement Analysis and Its Applications</h3>
            <p>Movement analysis is a systematic approach to improving performance and preventing injury. By breaking down complex skills into distinct phases, coaches and athletes can observe and quantify movement, allowing them to identify biomechanical flaws and pinpoint specific areas for improvement.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The "phases of movement" approach breaks down skills into a preparatory phase, force production phase, critical instant, and follow-through <span class="page-ref">p.359</span>.</li>
                <li>Discrete skills have a clear beginning and end (e.g., throwing a ball), while continuous skills have no clear beginning or end (e.g., running or swimming) <span class="page-ref">p.359, 361</span>.</li>
                <li>Movement analysis can help identify inefficient movement patterns that may contribute to the risk of injury <span class="page-ref">p.361</span>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To illustrate the phases of a discrete skill, consider the tennis forehand:</p>

            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preparatory Phase:</strong> The player rotates their trunk and takes the racket back to prepare for the forward swing <span class="page-ref">p.360, Image 1</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Force Production Phase:</strong> The player initiates a synchronized movement of the hips, trunk, and arm to accelerate the racket towards the ball <span class="page-ref">p.360, Images 2-3</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical Instant:</strong> This is the moment of contact between the racket and the ball, which influences the shot's outcome <span class="page-ref">p.360, Image 4</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow-through:</strong> The racket continues to move across the body after impact, which helps to safely decelerate the arm and maintain balance <span class="page-ref">p.360, Images 5-6</span>.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Example: Front Crawl in Swimming.</strong><br>
                Swimming is a continuous skill where the phases of movement are cyclical. For one arm stroke, the phases are Entry, Pull (when the hand moves backwards), Push (when the hand is aligned with the shoulder), and Recovery (when the hand exits the water). Analyzing these phases helps coaches identify issues like a poor "catch" during the pull phase, which can be corrected to improve propulsion <span class="page-ref">p.361</span>.
            </div>

            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>NOTE: The Importance of Follow-Through.</strong><br>
                The follow-through phase occurs after the critical instant, so it does not influence the outcome of that specific skill execution (e.g., the ball has already left the racket). Its primary roles are to help prevent injury by allowing for gradual deceleration of the limbs and to prepare the body for the next movement <span class="page-ref">p.360</span>.

                    <div class="mcq-explanation">
                        <strong>Why C is correct:</strong> When the projection height is above the landing area, as in a shot-put, the optimal projection angle is less than 45°. The provided text states for a shot-put, the typical angle is 35-42° <span class="page-ref">p.336-337</span>.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> 45° is the optimal angle only when the projection height and landing height are the same <span class="page-ref">p.336</span>.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> An angle greater than 45° is optimal when the projection height is below the landing area, such as in a basketball free throw <span class="page-ref">p.336</span>.<br><br>

                    <div class="mcq-explanation">
                        <strong>Why C is correct:</strong> Form drag (or pressure drag) is caused by the separation of the fluid flow behind an object, creating a low-pressure wake. Streamlining reduces the frontal area and helps the fluid remain attached to the surface for longer, significantly decreasing this type of drag <span class="page-ref">p.345</span>.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Surface drag is caused by friction between the fluid and the object's surface. While it is a factor, streamlining is primarily aimed at reducing form drag, which is more significant at higher speeds <span class="page-ref">p.343</span>. Swimmers reduce surface drag by shaving skin or wearing smooth suits <span class="page-ref">p.344</span>.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> Wave drag is caused by making waves at the interface between two fluids (like water and air) and is primarily relevant to sports like swimming and rowing, not cycling <span class="page-ref">p.347</span>.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> The Magnus force is a lift force generated by a spinning object and is not a type of drag <span class="page-ref">p.352</span>.

                        <strong>Why C is correct:</strong> The critical instant is the specific moment that influences the skill's outcome, such as the point of contact in striking sports or the point of release when throwing <span class="page-ref">p.359</span>.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> The preparatory phase involves the movements that get the athlete ready for the main action <span class="page-ref">p.359</span>.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> The force production phase involves the synchronized movements that generate force to be applied to an object <span class="page-ref">p.359</span>.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> The follow-through occurs immediately after the critical instant and is important for injury prevention and balance <span class="page-ref">p.360</span>.

                        The data shows that drafting during the cycling stage results in a lower oxygen uptake during the subsequent run. This suggests that drafting is an effective energy-saving strategy <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. By reducing air resistance during the cycle, the athlete expends less energy, which means they begin the run in a less fatigued state <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. This preserved energy allows for a more efficient run, as indicated by the lower physiological cost (oxygen uptake) at any given point compared to the non-drafting condition <strong>[1 mark]</strong>.

                        The answer can be justified for different positions. For example: The Guard position could be considered most demanding due to the high frequency of high-intensity movements. They perform the most sprints (67) <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. Although the average duration is shorter, this high number of accelerations and decelerations is very taxing. Alternatively, the Centre position could be argued as most demanding due to the high number of powerful jumps (49) combined with having the longest average sprint duration (2.2s), suggesting they cover more distance per sprint <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. A justified conclusion weighing these factors is required <strong>[1 mark]</strong>.

                        Newton's laws are fundamental to basketball. Newton's first law, inertia, is seen when a stationary ball remains at rest until a player applies a force to pass or shoot it <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. Newton's second law (F=ma) is demonstrated when a player shoots. To get the ball to the basket, the player must apply a force proportional to the mass of the ball to achieve the required acceleration. A greater force results in greater acceleration and a longer shot <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. Newton's third law, action-reaction, is evident when a player jumps. They push down on the floor (action), and the floor exerts an equal and opposite force upwards on the player (reaction), propelling them into the air for a rebound or shot <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. Stability is also key; when defending, a player widens their base of support and lowers their centre of mass to resist the force from an opponent, applying the principles of inertia and force <strong>[1 mark]</strong>.

                        A long jumper can manipulate three key factors of projectile motion to maximize their jump distance. The most important factor is the initial velocity at take-off; the faster the horizontal velocity from the run-up, the greater the horizontal distance the jumper will travel while airborne. Therefore, athletes aim to achieve maximum controllable speed on their approach <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. The second factor is the angle of projection at take-off. The optimal angle for a long jumper is between 18-27 degrees, which provides the best trade-off between maximizing flight time (vertical velocity) and maintaining horizontal velocity <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. The third factor is the height of release, which is the height of the jumper's centre of mass at take-off. A higher take-off position results in a longer flight time and thus a greater distance jumped. Jumpers achieve this through powerful extension of their take-off leg <strong>[1 mark]</strong>. While air resistance is also a factor, its effect is relatively minor compared to these three variables, which the athlete actively controls to improve performance <strong>[1 mark]</strong>.

            <h2>Mathematical Skills</h2>
            <p>Proficiency in SEHS requires you to be more than a theorist; you must be a quantitative problem-solver. Biomechanical principles are often expressed through equations, and demonstrating your ability to apply them is critical for success in Paper 1B and Paper 2. This section provides a worked example to sharpen these essential skills.</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Formula: Power</strong><br>
                Power is the rate at which work is done, or the product of force and velocity. It is a key component of athletic performance. The formula is: P = Fv <span class="page-ref">p.330</span>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Variables:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>P</strong> = Power (measured in Watts, W)</li>
                <li><strong>F</strong> = Force (measured in Newtons, N)</li>
                <li><strong>v</strong> = velocity (measured in metres per second, m s⁻¹)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Worked Example:</strong> A cyclist is riding at a constant velocity of 12 m s⁻¹. The total resistive force from air resistance and friction is 40 N. Calculate the power output of the cyclist.</p>

            <div class="working-steps">
                <h4>Step 1: Identify the known variables.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Force (F) = 40 N</li>
                    <li>velocity (v) = 12 m s⁻¹</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 2: State the formula.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>P = Fv</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>P = 40 N × 12 m s⁻¹</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 4: Calculate the result and include units.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>P = 480 W</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Answer: The power output of the cyclist is 480 Watts.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Practicing these types of calculations is vital for demonstrating your understanding in both Paper 1B and Paper 2.</p>

            <h2>Common Errors</h2>
            <p>Even with a strong understanding of the material, students can fall into common traps and misunderstandings related to the concepts in Topic B2. Being aware of these potential pitfalls is a key step toward avoiding them in an exam and ensuring your answers are precise and accurate.</p>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Confusing Mass and Weight</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">Students often use these terms interchangeably. Mass is the amount of matter in an object (kg) and is constant, whereas weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass (N) and varies with location <span class="page-ref">p.315</span>.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Misinterpreting Action-Reaction Pairs</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">A common error is applying Newton's third law to forces acting on a single object. Action-reaction forces always act on two different interacting objects. For example, the action is the foot pushing on the ground; the reaction is the ground pushing on the foot <span class="page-ref">p.316</span>.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Assuming Projectile Path is Controllable in Mid-Air</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">Athletes cannot change the parabolic trajectory of their centre of mass once they are airborne. They can only move their body segments around their centre of mass, such as in the high jump or diving <span class="page-ref">p.339</span>.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Applying the 45° Rule Universally</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">The 45° angle for maximum projectile range is only true when the launch and landing heights are equal. In most sports (e.g., shot put, basketball), this is not the case, and the optimal angle will be different <span class="page-ref">p.336</span>.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Believing Spin Creates Drag</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">While spin can affect a ball's flight, the primary aerodynamic force it generates is the Magnus force (a lift force), which causes the ball to curve. It is a separate concept from drag, which is the resistive force opposing motion <span class="page-ref">p.352</span>.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Ignoring the Role of Impulse</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">Students may focus only on maximum force. However, impulse (Force × time) is often more important. To achieve a large change in momentum (e.g., jumping high), an athlete must apply a large force for as long as possible <span class="page-ref">p.319-320</span>.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Thinking Inertia is a Force</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">Inertia is not a force; it is the property of an object that resists changes in its state of motion. An object has inertia, it does not experience an "inertial force" <span class="page-ref">p.315</span>.</div>
            </div>

            <p>During your revision, pay special attention to these concepts and double-check that your understanding is clear and correct.</p>

            <h2>Linking Questions</h2>
            <p>The IB SEHS curriculum is designed to be integrated, meaning concepts from one topic often connect to and reinforce others. Being able to make these connections demonstrates a deeper level of understanding. This section poses questions that link the concepts of forces and motion to other areas of the course to encourage holistic thinking.</p>

            <div class="linking-card">

                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider resistance training in water or on sand, which increases friction and drag to build muscular strength and endurance.</li>
                        <li>Think about speed and agility training using resistance bands or parachutes, which apply a drag force the athlete must overcome.</li>
                        <li>Consider how this type of training aids in technique development and injury prevention.</li>
                        <li>Think about the benefit of low-impact exercises in a swimming pool, where drag provides resistance while buoyancy reduces stress on joints.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Law of inertia: Coaches can advise on body positioning and stability to conserve energy and overcome an opponent's inertia.</li>
                        <li>Law of acceleration: Coaches can focus on enhancing power-to-weight ratio to maximize acceleration.</li>
                        <li>Law of action-reaction: Coaches can instruct athletes on how to apply forces against the ground (e.g., in running or jumping) or an object (e.g., in throwing) to generate powerful propulsive reaction forces.</li>
                        <li>Impulse and momentum: Coaches can focus on techniques that increase the time over which a force is applied (e.g., longer strides in running) to generate greater momentum.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
