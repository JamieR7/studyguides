        <!-- 4. CONTENT SUMMARY -->
        <span class="section-badge">📖 Section 4</span>
        <h2>Content summary</h2>

        <p>
            Topic B.2 applies mechanical principles to human movement, from Newton's laws to fluid dynamics, providing the scientific framework for analysing and optimizing performance.
        </p>

        <h3>B.2.1 Newton's laws of motion</h3>

        <p>
            Newton's three laws form the bedrock of biomechanics, explaining how forces create or change motion in all sporting contexts.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Core principles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vector vs scalar:</strong> Vectors have magnitude and direction (velocity, force); scalars have magnitude only (mass, speed).</li>
                <li><strong>Linear vs angular motion:</strong> Linear motion is movement along a straight line; angular motion is rotational.</li>
                <li><strong>Newton's First Law (Inertia):</strong> An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.</li>
                <li><strong>Newton's Second Law (Acceleration):</strong> Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma); greater force or smaller mass produces greater acceleration.</li>
                <li><strong>Newton's Third Law (Action–Reaction):</strong> For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force acting on a different object.</li>
                <li><strong>Impulse–momentum relationship:</strong> Impulse (force × time) equals change in momentum; athletes maximize impulse by applying large forces over extended time.</li>
                <li><strong>Friction:</strong> Resistive force between surfaces; can be beneficial (traction) or detrimental (energy loss).</li>
                <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Influenced by centre of mass height, base of support size, line of gravity position, and mass.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Impulse in action:</strong> A high jumper approaches with horizontal momentum, then applies large vertical force to the ground over an extended time (flexing then explosively extending the take-off leg), generating large vertical impulse that changes momentum from horizontal to vertical, propelling them upwards.
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Newton's Third Law:</strong> A sprinter pushing backwards and downwards on the blocks (action) receives an equal and opposite forwards and upwards force from the blocks (reaction), which accelerates them down the track.
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            <strong>Mass vs weight:</strong> Mass is the amount of matter (kg), constant everywhere. Weight is the gravitational force on that mass (N), varying with gravitational field strength. An athlete has the same mass on Earth and the Moon but weighs less on the Moon.
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Maximizing stability:</strong> Lower centre of mass, increase base of support, keep line of gravity within base. Wrestlers adopt a low, wide stance; basketball players balance stability (holding ground) with instability (changing direction quickly).
        </div>

        <h3>B.2.2 Fluid mechanics</h3>

        <p>
            Understanding how air and water exert forces on moving bodies is critical for optimizing performance in swimming, cycling, projectile sports and any activity involving fluid resistance.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Projectile motion and fluid forces</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Projectile motion factors:</strong> Initial velocity, angle of projection, and height of release determine trajectory once an object is airborne.</li>
                <li><strong>Centre of mass trajectory:</strong> Once airborne, the centre of mass follows a fixed parabolic path determined by the release parameters; limbs can move around it but the path itself cannot change.</li>
                <li><strong>Drag force:</strong> Resistive force opposing motion through fluid, comprising surface drag (friction with fluid), form drag (pressure differential due to shape), and wave drag (energy lost creating surface waves).</li>
                <li><strong>Lift force:</strong> Force perpendicular to motion direction, generated by pressure differences explained by Bernoulli's principle (faster fluid flow = lower pressure).</li>
                <li><strong>Magnus effect:</strong> Spinning projectile experiences lift force due to rotation creating velocity and pressure differentials; causes curve balls, swerving kicks, and spin-induced deviation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Magnus effect in football:</strong> A player striking a ball off-centre generates sidespin; the side rotating into oncoming air experiences higher pressure (slower velocity), while the side rotating away experiences lower pressure (faster velocity), creating a sideways Magnus force that curves the ball around a defensive wall.
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Drafting:</strong> Positioning directly behind a competitor creates slipstream, an area of lower pressure and reduced air resistance, significantly reducing energy required to maintain speed—critical in cycling and triathlon.
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            The IB Data Booklet provides formulas for drag and lift forces; you must be able to select and apply them to solve quantitative problems in Paper 1B.
        </div>

        <h3>B.2.3 Movement analysis and applications</h3>

        <p>
            A phases-of-movement approach provides systematic frameworks for deconstructing skills, identifying errors, and developing improvement strategies.
        </p>

        <div class="mechanism-steps">
            <h4>Phases of movement</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preparatory phase:</strong> Athlete positions body and prepares for force production (e.g., tennis backswing).</li>
                <li><strong>Force production phase:</strong> Synchronized sequence generating and transferring force (e.g., kinetic chain from legs through trunk to racquet).</li>
                <li><strong>Critical instant:</strong> Exact moment of contact or release determining accuracy, power, effectiveness (e.g., ball contact in tennis).</li>
                <li><strong>Follow-through:</strong> Continuation after critical instant, decelerating limb safely, preventing injury, maintaining balance (e.g., arm continuation after ball release).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="real-world-example">
            <strong>Continuous skill analysis:</strong> Front crawl stroke has cyclical phases—entry (hand enters water), pull (backwards propulsion), push (completing propulsion and exiting), recovery (arm moves forward over water). Analysing joint angles and timing in each phase identifies inefficiencies creating drag or reducing propulsion.
        </div>

        <div class="note-box">
            <strong>Discrete vs continuous:</strong> Discrete skills have clear start/end (throw, jump). Continuous skills are repetitive and cyclical with arbitrary start/end points (running, cycling, swimming).
        </div>

                    A larger mass provides greater stability because greater force is required to change its state of motion (inertia). Raising centre of mass (A), narrowing base (B), or moving line of gravity outside base (C) all decrease stability.

                    <strong>Surface drag:</strong> Frictional drag between skin and water.

                    <strong>Form drag:</strong> Pressure drag from shape and frontal area. Minimize by adopting highly streamlined horizontal position, especially during glide after starts/turns, reducing frontal surface area pushing against water, which reduces low-pressure wake size and lowers overall pressure differential. <strong>[2 marks]</strong><br><br>

Minimize by swimming underwater for maximum allowed distance (15 m) after starts/turns where wave drag is negligible, and using efficient stroke techniques creating minimal surface disturbance, preventing energy waste on waves rather than propulsion. <strong>[2 marks]</strong>

            </div>
            <div class="linking-answer">
                Friction and drag principles are applied to create specific resistance training methods enhancing muscular strength and power. Athletes use resistance bands, parachutes (increasing air drag), or train in water/sand (utilizing fluid/frictional resistance) to increase force muscles must overcome, applying overload principle and leading to greater physiological adaptations.

            <div class="linking-answer">
                The impulse–momentum relationship is fundamental to injury prevention when absorbing impacts. Landing from a jump with significant momentum, athletes increase stopping time by bending knees, ankles, hips; because impulse (FΔt) is constant for given landing, increasing time decreases average impact force on joints/tissues. This "cushioning" dissipates force safely, reducing acute injury risk.
