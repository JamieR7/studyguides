The first is the preparatory phase, where the player gets into position and begins the backswing. The second is the force production phase, which involves the synchronized movement of the skeletal and muscular systems to generate force for the forward swing. The third is the critical instant, which is the exact moment of contact between the racket and the ball. Finally, the follow-through occurs after the critical instant, continuing the motion to ensure body alignment, prevent injury, and maintain control.</td>

Angular momentum is the product of the moment of inertia and angular velocity (L = Iω). To increase their angular velocity (rate of rotation), a figure skater must decrease their moment of inertia. They achieve this by pulling their arms and legs in close to their axis of rotation. This redistribution of mass reduces the moment of inertia, and because angular momentum (L) must be conserved, the angular velocity (ω) must increase proportionally.</td>

First is the height of their centre of mass relative to the supporting surface; by lowering their stance, they lower their centre of mass, which increases stability. Second is the size of the base of support; a wider stance with their feet spread apart creates a larger base of support, enhancing stability. Third is the position of the line of gravity relative to the base of support; to remain stable, the wrestler must ensure their line of gravity falls within their base of support. Finally, the mass of the wrestler provides greater stability, as a larger force is required to overcome their inertia.</td>

                        <td><strong>Example:</strong> Evaluate the practice of athletes manipulating friction to improve performance.<br><br><strong>Model Answer:</strong> Manipulating friction is a key strategy for athletes across many sports, offering significant advantages but also presenting limitations.<br><br><strong>Strengths:</strong><br>1. Increased friction can enhance grip and power transfer. For example, badminton players wear shoes with high-coefficient-of-friction soles to allow for rapid starts, stops, and changes of direction without slipping. Similarly, gymnasts apply chalk to their hands to increase friction on the rings, ensuring a secure hold.<br>2. Decreased friction is crucial for maximizing speed in sliding sports. Downhill skiers wax their skis to reduce the coefficient of friction between the ski and the snow, which minimizes the resistive frictional force and allows them to achieve higher velocities.<br><br><strong>Limitations:</strong><br>1. Excessive friction can be counterproductive and lead to injury. For instance, a runner's shoe with too much grip on an artificial surface can lead to joint injuries if the foot cannot rotate naturally during a change of direction. Blisters are a common result of static or dynamic friction between the skin and equipment.<br>2. The manipulation of friction is highly dependent on environmental conditions. The type of wax a skier uses is specific to the snow temperature and texture, and the wrong choice can increase friction. Similarly, the effectiveness of a shoe's grip can change dramatically if the playing surface becomes wet.</td>

            <p>Now that we have reviewed the language of the exam, we can proceed to the core content of the topic where these principles are explored in detail.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 4 -->
            <span class="section-badge">📖 Section 4</span>
            <h2>Content Summary</h2>
            <p>Topic B.2 is divided into three core areas: the fundamental laws that govern why and how things move, the complex interaction of bodies with fluids like air and water, and the systematic analysis of movement patterns to enhance performance. This section will deconstruct each of these areas to build a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics of human movement.</p>

            <h3>B.2.1 Newton's laws of motion</h3>
            <p>Sir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion form the bedrock of classical mechanics and, by extension, sports biomechanics. They provide the essential framework for analysing the forces that cause, change, or prevent movement in athletic contexts, offering a powerful tool for understanding why athletes move the way they do.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kinematics is the study of motion without reference to the forces causing it, including both linear and angular motion.</li>
                <li>Measurements can be scalars (size only, e.g., speed, distance) or vectors (size and direction, e.g., velocity, displacement).</li>
                <li>Newton's first law (Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</li>
                <li>Newton's second law (Acceleration): The acceleration of a body is proportional to the force causing it and in the same direction (F = ma).</li>
                <li>Newton's third law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
                <li>Linear momentum is the product of mass and velocity (p = mv), and linear impulse is the product of force and time (J = FΔt).</li>
                <li>Angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity (L = Iω). It is conserved when an athlete is airborne.</li>
                <li>Friction is a force that opposes motion and is determined by the coefficient of friction and the normal reaction force.</li>
                <li>Work is done when a force is applied over a distance (W = Fd), and Power is the rate at which work is done (P = Fv).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Mechanism Explained: Conservation of Angular Momentum</strong></p>
            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>A diver stands on a platform, possessing zero angular momentum. To initiate a somersault, they must apply an eccentric force to the board.</li>
                    <li>The board exerts an equal and opposite reaction force back on the diver that does not pass through their centre of mass, creating a torque that generates angular momentum.</li>
                    <li>Once the diver is airborne, no external torques act on them (ignoring air resistance), so their angular momentum remains constant.</li>
                    <li>To increase their rate of rotation (angular velocity), the diver moves into a "tuck" position. This brings their mass closer to the axis of rotation, decreasing their moment of inertia.</li>
                    <li>Because angular momentum (L = Iω) is conserved, a decrease in the moment of inertia (I) must cause a proportional increase in angular velocity (ω), making them spin faster.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Real-World Sporting Example:</strong><br>
                A sprinter uses Newton's third law to accelerate from the starting blocks. They push backwards and downwards on the blocks with large forces (action). The blocks then push forwards and upwards on the sprinter with an equal and opposite force (reaction), propelling them forwards out of the blocks.
            </div>

            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>NOTE:</strong><br>
                A common error is to confuse mass and weight. Mass is the amount of matter in an object (kg), while weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass (Fg = mg). An athlete's mass is the same on Earth and the Moon, but their weight is less on the Moon.
            </div>

            <h3>B.2.2 Fluid mechanics</h3>
            <p>Athletic performance is rarely conducted in a vacuum; athletes are constantly interacting with fluids like air or water. This section analyses the critical, and often invisible, forces exerted by these fluids, which can significantly help or hinder performance and often determine the outcome of an event.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A projectile is an object projected into the air, subject only to the forces of gravity and air resistance.</li>
                <li>The pathway (range) of a projectile depends on three initial conditions: initial velocity, angle of projection, and height of release.</li>
                <li>The centre of mass is the mathematical point around which the mass of a body is evenly distributed. Its pathway is fixed upon take-off, though the athlete can move their limbs around it.</li>
                <li>Drag is a resistive force that opposes motion through a fluid and has three components: surface drag (friction), form drag (pressure), and wave drag (in water).</li>
                <li>Bernoulli's principle states that the pressure exerted by a fluid is inversely related to its velocity. This principle generates lift force.</li>
                <li>The Magnus effect explains how spin on a ball creates a pressure differential and a swerving Magnus force, as seen in a curving free kick in soccer.</li>
                <li>Drafting is a technique used by athletes to reduce drag by positioning themselves in the wake of a leading athlete, which has been shown to reduce drag by more than 25%.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Mechanism Explained: Generating Lift on an Aerofoil</strong></p>
            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>An aerofoil, like an airplane wing or a discus, is shaped asymmetrically.</li>
                    <li>As it moves through the air, the air must travel further and faster over the curved upper surface than the flatter lower surface.</li>
                    <li>According to Bernoulli's principle, the faster-moving air on the top surface exerts lower pressure than the slower-moving air on the bottom surface.</li>
                    <li>This pressure differential creates a net upward force perpendicular to the direction of motion, known as lift.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Real-World Sporting Example:</strong><br>
                A swimmer streamlines their body position after a dive or a turn to minimize form drag. By keeping their body long and narrow with arms extended, they reduce their frontal surface area. This reduces the pressure differential between the front and back of their body, minimizing the size of the turbulent "wake" and allowing them to glide further and faster.
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>TIP:</strong><br>
                The optimal angle of projection is not always 45°. If the release height is above the landing height (e.g., a shot put), the optimal angle is less than 45°. If the release height is below the landing height (e.g., a basketball free throw), the optimal angle is greater than 45°.
            </div>

            <h3>B.2.3 Movement analysis and its applications</h3>
            <p>To improve a complex athletic skill, it must first be deconstructed into manageable parts. This section introduces the "phases of movement" approach, a systematic method used by coaches and biomechanists to analyse and refine athletic technique. This analytical process is key to enhancing performance, maximizing efficiency, and preventing injury.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Skills can be classified as discrete (clear beginning and end, e.g., a golf swing) or continuous (no clear beginning or end, e.g., running or swimming).</li>
                <li>The phases of movement approach breaks down a skill into four main parts for analysis.</li>
                <li>Preparatory phase: The initial stage where the athlete gets ready and positions their body for the skill.</li>
                <li>Force production phase: The synchronized movement of the muscular and skeletal systems to generate the force needed for the skill.</li>
                <li>Critical instant: The specific moment in time that determines the skill's outcome, such as the point of release or contact.</li>
                <li>Follow-through: The continuation of movement after the critical instant, which helps to decelerate the body, prevent injury, and ensure accuracy.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Mechanism Explained: Movement Analysis of a Front Crawl Arm Stroke</strong></p>
            <div class="mechanism-steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>The front crawl is a continuous skill, so the phases are analysed for a single arm cycle. The cycle is divided into four phases based on the arm's movement.</li>
                    <li>Entry phase: The hand enters the water, beginning the propulsive action.</li>
                    <li>Pull phase: The hand begins moving backwards on the horizontal axis, generating propulsive force.</li>
                    <li>Push phase: The hand is aligned vertically with the shoulder and continues to push backwards until it exits the water.</li>
                    <li>Recovery phase: This phase takes place after the hand exits the water, as the arm moves forwards through the air to begin the next stroke. This is the recovery phase for the arm, but the critical instant for the overall stroke occurs during the propulsive pull and push phases.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Real-World Sporting Example:</strong><br>
                Video analysis is used to break down a baseball pitcher's throw into phases. A coach can identify biomechanical flaws, such as improper sequencing of hip and shoulder rotation during the force production phase, or an abrupt stop instead of a smooth follow-through. By identifying these issues, the coach can provide targeted feedback and drills to improve performance and reduce the risk of shoulder or elbow injury.
            </div>

            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>NOTE:</strong><br>
                The primary benefit of movement analysis is its application to health and safety. By identifying inefficient movement patterns that place extra pressure on joints or tissues, healthcare professionals and coaches can design interventions to correct these flaws, significantly reducing the risk of injury.

            <p>Having reviewed the core theoretical content, the next step is to bridge the gap between understanding the theory and applying it in an exam context.</p>

                    <span class="mcq-answer-label">✓ Correct Answer: C</span>
                    <div class="mcq-explanation">
                        <strong>Why C is correct:</strong> To generate the torque required for rotation, the gymnast applies an eccentric force (an action) to the vaulting table. The table then exerts an equal and opposite reaction force back on the gymnast, which causes them to rotate.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> The law of inertia explains why the gymnast's state of motion changes, but not the specific mechanism of generating rotation from a surface.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> The law of acceleration relates force to linear acceleration (F=ma), but the action-reaction pair is the more direct explanation for generating the initial force for rotation.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> The law of conservation of momentum applies once the gymnast is airborne and no longer in contact with the table.

                <div class="mcq-question">A shot-putter releases the shot at a height of 2.1 m above the ground, which lands on the ground. To achieve the maximum possible range, the optimal angle of projection should be:</div>
                <ul class="mcq-options">
                    <li>A. Exactly 45°</li>
                    <li>B. Greater than 45°</li>
                    <li>C. Less than 45°</li>
                    <li>D. Dependent only on the initial velocity</li>

                    <span class="mcq-answer-label">✓ Correct Answer: C</span>
                    <div class="mcq-explanation">
                        <strong>Why C is correct:</strong> When the projection height is above the landing area, the optimal projection angle is below 45°. This is because the shot has extra flight time due to the release height, so a slightly flatter trajectory maximizes the horizontal distance.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> 45° is the optimal angle only when the projection height and landing height are the same.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> A projection angle greater than 45° is optimal when the projection height is below the landing area (e.g., shooting a basketball).<br><br>
                        <strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> While initial velocity is a major factor in determining range, the angle of projection is also critically important for optimizing that range.

                    <div class="mcq-explanation">
                        <strong>Why B is correct:</strong> Form drag (or pressure drag) is related to the cross-sectional area of the object moving through the fluid. By adopting a streamlined shape, a swimmer reduces their frontal area, which reduces the pressure differential and minimizes form drag.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> The texture of the swimsuit primarily affects surface drag (skin friction), not form drag.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Water temperature affects fluid density, which influences drag, but it is an environmental factor, not something the athlete directly manipulates to reduce form drag specifically.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> The speed of the swimmer affects the magnitude of the drag force, but it does not change the principles used to minimize form drag itself.

                    <li>D. The total angular momentum of the body decreases due to air resistance.</li>

                <div class="mcq-answer-box">
                    <span class="mcq-answer-label">✓ Correct Answer: B</span>
                    <div class="mcq-explanation">
                        <strong>Why B is correct:</strong> This is an example of transfer of angular momentum. As the diver flexes their hips, their upper body's angular velocity increases, and so does its angular momentum. To conserve the total angular momentum of the whole body (which remains constant in the air), the lower body must slow its rotation, causing its angular momentum to decrease.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> The total angular momentum of the body is conserved while airborne and cannot increase without an external torque.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Analysis of this movement shows the angular momentum of the upper body increasing while the angular momentum of the lower body decreases to compensate.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> While air resistance technically exists, its effect is considered negligible in this context, and the primary principle being demonstrated is the transfer of momentum between body segments.

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Drafting during the cycling stage had a clear positive effect on subsequent running performance. The heart rate during the run was consistently lower in the 5RunD trial compared to the 5RunND trial. This indicates that drafting saved energy during the cycling portion, resulting in less physiological strain and allowing the athlete to run at a lower relative intensity, as shown by the lower heart rate. <strong>[3 marks]</strong>

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> There is a positive correlation between the angle of attack and the frontal surface area. As the swimmer increases their angle of attack from 0 to 4.5 degrees, their body becomes less streamlined relative to the direction of motion, which causes their projected frontal surface area to increase. <strong>[2 marks]</strong>

                        A downhill skier's primary goal is to maximize speed by minimizing the resistive forces acting upon them, principally friction and air drag.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Friction:</strong> The main source of friction is between the skis and the snow. To minimize this, skiers apply a specific type of wax to the base of their skis. This wax is chosen based on the temperature and condition of the snow to create a thin layer of water, which significantly reduces the coefficient of dynamic friction. By minimizing this resistive force, less of the gravitational potential energy is lost to friction, allowing for greater acceleration and higher top speeds. <strong>[3 marks]</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Drag:</strong> Air resistance, or drag, is the most significant resistive force at the high speeds achieved in downhill skiing. To minimize drag, skiers adopt a low "tuck" position. This posture dramatically reduces their frontal surface area, which is a key component of form drag. By making their body shape as streamlined as possible, they reduce the pressure drag created by air turbulence. Furthermore, the smooth, tight-fitting race suits they wear are designed to minimize surface drag by reducing the friction between the air and the athlete's body. By effectively minimizing both friction and drag, the net propulsive force (gravity) has a greater effect, maximizing their acceleration and average speed. <strong>[3 marks]</strong>

                        A diver performing a forward somersault provides an excellent example of generating and controlling angular momentum.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Generation:</strong> The diver cannot generate angular momentum once they are airborne. It must be created before they leave the diving board. They do this by applying a force to the end of the board, and as they jump, the board provides an equal and opposite reaction force. This reaction force is applied to their feet but does not pass through their centre of mass. This creates a torque, or turning force, which generates the initial angular momentum for the somersault. <strong>[3 marks]</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Control:</strong> Once airborne, their total angular momentum is conserved. To control the speed of their rotation, they manipulate their moment of inertia. By pulling into a tight tuck position, they bring their mass closer to their axis of rotation, decreasing their moment of inertia. To conserve angular momentum (L=Iω), this decrease in 'I' causes a proportional increase in angular velocity 'ω', and they spin faster. To slow down their rotation to prepare for entry into the water, they open their body out of the tuck. This increases their moment of inertia, which in turn decreases their angular velocity, allowing for a controlled, vertical entry into the water. <strong>[3 marks]</strong>

            <span class="section-badge">🔢 Section 6</span>
            <h2>Mathematical Skills</h2>
            <p>Biomechanics is a quantitative science, and the IB SEHS exam reflects this. A conceptual understanding is foundational, but you must also be able to apply key formulas to calculate variables related to motion, force, work, and power. Demonstrating the correct working is as important as reaching the correct final answer.</p>

            <h3>Core Formula: Impulse</h3>
            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Formula:</strong> Impulse (J) = Force (F) × change in time (Δt)
            </div>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Impulse is the product of force and the time for which it acts. It is a vector quantity that is directly responsible for an object's change in momentum. Maximizing impulse is key in sports that require a large change in velocity, such as a high jump take-off or a powerful shot in soccer.</p>

            <p><strong>Worked Example:</strong> A soccer player kicks a stationary ball, applying an average force of 900 N for a duration of 0.04 seconds. Calculate the impulse generated on the ball.</p>
            <div class="working-steps">
                <h4>Step 1: Identify the known variables.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Force (F) = 900 N</li>
                    <li>Change in time (Δt) = 0.04 s</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 2: State the formula.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>J = F × Δt</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>J = 900 N × 0.04 s</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 4: Calculate the result and state the units.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>J = 36 Ns</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>The impulse generated is 36 Ns.</p>

            <h3>Core Formula: Work</h3>
            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Formula:</strong> Work (W) = Force (F) × distance (d)
            </div>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Work is done when a force causes an object to be displaced. In biomechanics, it represents the energy transferred to or from an object. For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction as the displacement.</p>

            <p><strong>Worked Example:</strong> A weightlifter exerts an average upward vertical force of 1800 N to lift a barbell a vertical distance of 2.1 meters from the floor. Calculate the work done on the barbell.</p>
            <div class="working-steps">
                <h4>Step 1: Identify the known variables.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Force (F) = 1800 N</li>
                    <li>Distance (d) = 2.1 m</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 2: State the formula.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>W = F × d</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>W = 1800 N × 2.1 m</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 4: Calculate the result and state the units.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>W = 3780 Joules</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>The work done on the barbell is 3780 J.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Core Formula: Power</h3>
            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Formula:</strong> Power (P) = Force (F) × velocity (v)
            </div>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Power is a measure of the rate at which work is done and is a key component of successful athletic performance. It represents the ability to apply strength at speed. Power output is crucial in explosive activities like sprinting, jumping, and throwing.</p>

            <p><strong>Worked Example:</strong> A cyclist is cycling at a constant velocity of 12 m s⁻¹. They are generating a propulsive force of 60 N to overcome the resistive forces of drag and friction. Calculate the power output of the cyclist.</p>
            <div class="working-steps">

                <ul>
                    <li>P = 60 N × 12 m s⁻¹</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 4: Calculate the result and state the units.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>P = 720 Watts</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>

            <h3>Core Formula: Drag Force</h3>
            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Formula:</strong> F_drag = ½ C<sub>d</sub> A p v²
            </div>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This formula calculates the resistive drag force acting on an object moving through a fluid. The force is dependent on the drag coefficient (C<sub>d</sub>, a measure of the object's shape), its frontal surface area (A), the density of the fluid (p), and the square of the object's velocity (v).</p>

            <p><strong>Worked Example:</strong> A competitive cyclist in a time trial has a frontal area (A) of 0.35 m², a drag coefficient (C<sub>d</sub>) of 0.88, and is moving at 14 m s⁻¹ through air with a density (p) of 1.2 kg m⁻³. Calculate the drag force they are experiencing.</p>
            <div class="working-steps">
                <h4>Step 1: Identify the known variables.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>C<sub>d</sub> = 0.88</li>
                    <li>A = 0.35 m²</li>
                    <li>p = 1.2 kg m⁻³</li>
                    <li>v = 14 m s⁻¹</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 2: State the formula.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>F_drag = ½ C<sub>d</sub> A p v²</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>F_drag = 0.5 × 0.88 × 0.35 m² × 1.2 kg m⁻³ × (14 m s⁻¹)²</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 4: Calculate the result and state the units.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>F_drag = 0.5 × 0.88 × 0.35 × 1.2 × 196 = 36.2 N</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>The drag force experienced by the cyclist is 36.2 N.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Common Errors</h2>
            <p>Understanding common mistakes is a valuable revision tool. By actively identifying and clarifying frequent misconceptions related to Topic B.2, you can avoid these pitfalls in your exam responses and demonstrate a more robust and accurate understanding of the material.</p>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Confusing Mass and Weight</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">Students often use these terms interchangeably. Remember that mass (kg) is a measure of matter, while weight (N) is the force of gravity on that mass. An object's mass is constant, but its weight changes depending on the gravitational field.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Misunderstanding Newton's Third Law</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">A common error is to think that action-reaction forces cancel each other out. They do not, because they act on different objects. The sprinter pushes on the block (action), and the block pushes on the sprinter (reaction). The force on the sprinter is what causes them to accelerate.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Assuming 45° is Always the Optimal Angle</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">Students often memorize that 45° is the best angle for projectile range. This is only true if the release and landing heights are identical. For most sports (e.g., shot put, basketball shot), they are not, and the optimal angle changes accordingly.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Forgetting Air Resistance in Conservation of Momentum</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">When an athlete is airborne, we say angular momentum is conserved. This assumes that the effect of air resistance is negligible. While true for modelling purposes in most sports, it's important to recognize it's a simplification and that a very small external torque from air resistance does exist.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Believing Athletes Can Change Path of Centre of Mass Mid-Air</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">Once a long jumper is airborne, the flight path of their centre of mass is determined and cannot be changed. They can move their limbs around their centre of mass (e.g., the hang technique), but this only changes their body position, not the trajectory of their centre of mass.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="error-card">
                <div class="error-title">Confusing Types of Drag</div>
                <div class="error-explanation">Students often mix up surface drag and form drag. Surface drag is about fluid friction against the object's surface (like a smooth swimsuit vs. skin). Form drag is about the object's shape and the pressure differential it creates (like a streamlined cyclist vs. an upright one).</div>
            </div>

            <p>To achieve the highest marks, it is important to think beyond single topics and see how these concepts connect to the wider SEHS curriculum.</p>

            <h2>Linking Questions</h2>
            <p>The IB SEHS syllabus is designed to be interconnected. The strongest students are those who can synthesize knowledge from different topics, demonstrating a holistic understanding of sport, exercise, and health. The following prompts are designed to help you practice making these critical connections.</p>

                        <li>Consider how the musculoskeletal system creates both movement and stability. A stable base of support is required to effectively operate the lever systems of the limbs to produce maximal force.</li>
                        <li>Think about a weightlifter's stance (wide base of support, low centre of mass) creating stability, which allows the lever systems of their legs and back to lift a maximal load.</li>
