                                        are several issues. Firstly, accuracy depends on the athlete's honesty; they may
                                        fake answers to look "better" (social desirability bias). Secondly, the
                                        questions
                                        can be ambiguous and interpreted differently by different people. Thirdly, these
                                        tests often measure traits (stable) but do not account for the state
                                        (situation),
                                        meaning they may not successfully predict actual behavior in a specific sporting

                        <p>This section breaks down the two main pillars of Topic C.1: Personality and
                            Mental Toughness.
                            Understanding these concepts allows us to appreciate why athletes behave
                            differently and how
                            psychological resilience can be developed.</p>

                        <h3>C.1.1 Personality</h3>
                        <p>Personality refers to the stable, enduring characteristics that make an
                            individual unique. In
                            sport,
                            understanding personality helps coaches tailor their approach to motivation,
                            feedback, and
                            team
                            dynamics.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Trait Theory:</strong> Suggests personality is innate and stable.
                                Traits (e.g.,
                                aggression,
                                introversion) predispose an athlete to act in a certain way. However, this
                                theory is
                                criticized for
                                ignoring the impact of the situation.</li>

                                psychology. It
                                states that behavior is a mix of personality traits and environmental
                                factors. For
                                example, a
                                normally calm athlete (trait) might become aggressive (behavior) in a
                                high-stakes derby
                                match

                            <strong>Real-World Example: Introverts vs. Extroverts</strong><br>
                            Research suggests that extroverts, who have lower levels of natural arousal, may
                            seek out
                            high-stimulation sports (e.g., rugby, boxing) to reach their optimal arousal
                            level.
                            Conversely,
                            introverts, who have higher baseline arousal, may prefer low-stimulation,
                            precision sports
                            (e.g.,
                            archery, shooting) to avoid over-arousal.

                        <p>Mental toughness is the psychological edge that allows athletes to cope better
                            than their

                            the demands of competition, training, and lifestyle. It is crucial for
                            consistency and
                            resilience.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Mental toughness is defined as the ability to rebound from failure, cope

                                and persist

                                    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Emotional control (keeping emotions in
                                        check) and Life
                                        control

                                    <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Setting goals and sticking to them;
                                        reliability and
                                        discipline.

                            While mental toughness helps athletes cope with stress, it is not the same as
                            mental health.
                            A mentally
                            tough athlete can still experience mental health issues. Coaches must be careful
                            not to
                            assume that
                            "tough" athletes don't need emotional support.

                                                    <strong>Control</strong> refers to an athlete's ability to regulate
