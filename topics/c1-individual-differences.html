        <span class="section-badge">📚 Section 1</span>
        <h2>Quick reference: key terms</h2>

        <p>
            In the 2026 IB Sports, Exercise and Health Science (SEHS) syllabus, the mastery of precise terminology is the cornerstone of securing Assessment Objective 1 (AO1) marks. Examiners frequently note that candidates lose easy marks by providing vague descriptions rather than the specific, technical definitions required by the markscheme. These definitions serve as the prerequisite for the higher-level analysis (AO3) demanded in Paper 2.

            Psychological constructs explain the "performance gap"—why athletes with similar physiological profiles often achieve different outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>C.1.1 Personality</h3>

        <p>
            Personality is the unique intersection of nature and nurture.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trait-based approach:</strong> Enduring, stable characteristics (p.45).</li>
            <li><strong>The Big Five (OCEAN):</strong> Openness (originality), Conscientiousness (goal-direction), Extraversion (social energy), Agreeableness (relationships), and Neuroticism (distress perception) (p.45-46).</li>
            <li><strong>Social Learning Theory (HL):</strong> Imitation is dictated by the "regard" for the role model (p.46).</li>
            <li><strong>Malleability (HL):</strong> Personality can change through significant experience and coaching over time (p.46).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C.1.2 Mental Toughness</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Appraisal of challenges, commitment, confidence, perceived control, and resilience (p.46).</li>
            <li><strong>Self-fulfilling prophecy (HL):</strong> Confidence → persistence → success.</li>
            <li><strong>Learned Helplessness (HL):</strong> Perceived lack of control over future outcomes (p.46).</li>
        </ul>

            <ol>

                <li><strong>Increased Persistence:</strong> This perception triggers greater effort in training and competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome Success:</strong> High effort increases the statistical probability of eventual achievement (p.46).</li>

            <strong>Sporting Example</strong><br>
            A marathon runner high in Conscientiousness adheres strictly to a training macrocycle. When facing "the wall" at mile 20, their Mental Toughness allows them to appraise the pain as a challenge. Their Resilience prevents them from succumbing to Learned Helplessness, ensuring they maintain pace to the finish.

        <h2>Practice questions</h2>

        <p>
            The "So What?" layer of the exam requires differentiating between similar terms (e.g., arousal as activation vs. anxiety as a negative response).

                    Personality traits influence the environments athletes seek. An individual high in Extraversion may prefer team sports like rugby for social energy, whereas high Introversion might lead to individual sports like marathon running. Conscientiousness drives adherence to training cycles, vital for long-term success. Within teams, Agreeableness fosters cooperation and reduces conflict. However, high Neuroticism may lead an athlete to perceive competition as distressing, potentially requiring mental toughness training to prevent performance declines (p.45-46).
