                        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This sub-topic covers the essential principles for designing safe
                            and
                            effective training programs to improve both health and performance. It introduces the
                            concept of
                            periodization for long-term planning and explores the risks associated with poorly designed
                            programs,
                            such as overtraining.</p>

                        <p><strong>Core Concepts:</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Training Principles:</strong> The design of any effective training program is
                            directed by several
                            common principles:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> Training should be relevant to the individual's goals or
                                the demands
                                of the sport.</li>
                            <li><strong>Progressive Overload:</strong> The body must be subjected to a gradually
                                increasing load
                                (via frequency, intensity, or duration) to stimulate adaptation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Adequate rest is necessary for the body to adapt and repair,
                                preventing
                                burnout and injury.</li>
                            <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Changing routines can prevent boredom and stimulate new
                                adaptations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> Fitness gains are lost when training ceases.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Periodization:</strong> To optimize athletic performance, long-term training is
                            structured into
                            distinct phases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Macrocycles:</strong> The overall long-term plan, often lasting a year or an
                                entire season.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mesocycles:</strong> Medium-term blocks within the macrocycle, typically lasting
                                several
                                weeks, focusing on a specific goal (e.g., strength or endurance).</li>
                            <li><strong>Microcycles:</strong> Short-term plans, usually a week long, detailing daily
                                workouts.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Individual Differences & Adaptation:</strong> An individual's response to training is
                            influenced
                            by numerous factors, including the training intensity and methods used, genetics, age, sex
                            differences,
                            and hormonal fluctuations such as those during the menstrual cycle.</p>

                        <p><strong>Consequences of Poor Design:</strong> Poorly designed or maintained programs can lead
                            to negative
                            outcomes. It is crucial to differentiate between non-functional overreaching, a state of
                            intensified
                            training that leads to a temporary performance drop, and overtraining, a more severe
                            condition
                            characterized by long-term performance decrements and maladaptation.</p>

                            The principle of progressive overload is fundamental to increasing power output. In bobsled
                            racing,
                            athletes must generate explosive power during the initial push-off phase. A progressive
                            overload
                            strength training program, focusing on the extension of lower limb joints, results in
                            increased muscle
                            strength. This enhanced strength allows the athlete to generate more muscle power, leading
                            to greater
                            acceleration and a faster start. (Source: IB SEHS Sample Exam Answers.docx, Paper 2, Q1.e)

                        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This sub-topic shifts the focus from athletic performance to
                            general
                            well-being, exploring how a physically active lifestyle supports overall health and reduces
                            the risk of
                            major chronic diseases.</p>

                        <p><strong>Core Concepts:</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Energy Balance:</strong> This fundamental concept consists of three components:
                            energy intake
                            (from food and drink), energy consumption (metabolism and physical activity), and energy
                            storage (as
                            fat). An active lifestyle helps maintain a healthy balance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Systemic Benefits:</strong> Regular physical activity has a positive effect on both
                            muscular
                            system function, maintaining strength and mobility, and immune system function, enhancing
                            the body's
                            ability to fight off illness.</p>

                        <p><strong>Disease Risk Reduction:</strong> An active lifestyle is a powerful tool for
                            prevention,
                            significantly reducing the risk of developing several chronic conditions, including
                            osteoporosis,
                            obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

                        <p><strong>(HL Only) Exercise Prescription:</strong> Prescribing exercise requires careful
                            consideration,
                            especially for specific populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant
                            individuals. It is
                            essential to implement an appropriate progression of exercise intensity to maximize benefits
                            while
                            minimizing the risk of injury.</p>

                            The principles of SEHS are broadly applicable. A sports, exercise, and health scientist is
                            as proficient
                            in prescribing exercise to improve general health and well-being in the wider population as

                        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This higher-level sub-topic examines the complex physiological and
                            psychological causes of fatigue during exercise. It also evaluates the various strategies
                            and techniques
                            that athletes use to accelerate recovery, optimize adaptation, and sustain high performance
                            levels.</p>

                        <p><strong>Core Concepts:</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Sources of Fatigue:</strong> Fatigue is a multifactorial phenomenon. Key contributors
                            include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Insufficient fuel availability:</strong> Depletion of high-energy compounds like
                                phosphocreatine and stored carbohydrates (glycogen) in the liver and muscles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Metabolic by-products:</strong> Accumulation of substances that interfere with
                                muscle
                                function, including variations in ion concentration (sodium, potassium), acidosis
                                (increased H+
                                ions), and inorganic phosphate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thermoregulatory stress:</strong> Conditions like dehydration and hyperthermia
                                (elevated
                                core body temperature) impair cardiovascular function and performance.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Signs of Recovery:</strong> An athlete's recovery status can be assessed through
                            various
                            indicators:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physiological:</strong> e.g., reduced blood lactate concentration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Symptomatic:</strong> e.g., reduced muscle soreness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychological:</strong> e.g., improved preparedness for the next session.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Recovery Strategies:</strong> Various strategies can be employed to enhance recovery,
                            each with
                            its own evidence base.</p>

                            An athlete can proactively manage the onset of fatigue during an event by carefully planning
                            their fuel
                            and liquid intake. Consuming carbohydrates and fluids at strategic intervals helps to spare
                            muscle
                            glycogen and prevent dehydration, directly addressing two major causes of performance
                            impairment.

                                programs,

                                represent different points on a continuum of maladaptation. According to syllabus point

                                non-functional overreaching involves a temporary performance decrement that may require

                                recovery is significantly longer, more complex, and often involves significant
